- never add fallbacks unless explicitly told to do so
- never catch exceptions unless explicitly told to do so. let them bubble up and crash the application.
- if you cannot implement something like instructed, don't implement it differently, let me know
- we are using java modules, remeber that you might need to export and import symbols
- NEVER disable or bypass Java modules to try to make something work. We added modules for a reason.
