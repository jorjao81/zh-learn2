| ID | Category | Chinese | Pinyin | Meaning |
|----|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 五45 | Conjunction | 尽管……，但是/可是…… | jǐnguǎn..., dànshì/kěshì... | even though... but...; despite |

## 1. Core Concept: The Concessive Conjunction

As a conjunction (连词), **尽管** (jǐnguǎn) functions primarily to introduce a **concessive clause**. It acknowledges a fact or condition that creates an expectation, which the main clause then contradicts.

In this usage, it is synonymous with **虽然** (suīrán), meaning "although" or "even though."

* **Logic:** "Granting that X is true, Y is arguably surprising."
* **Structure:** `尽管 [Concession], [Counter-expectation]`
  * Often paired with **但是** (dànshì), **可是** (kěshì), **却** (què), or **还是** (háishì).

> **尽管**身体不好，他**还是**坚持工作。
> *Even though his health is poor, he still persists in working.*

## 2. Syntactic & Stylistic Nuances

### A. Comparison with 虽然 (suīrán)
While often interchangeable, `尽管` carries a slightly heavier tone than `虽然`.
* **虽然**: Purely factual concession. Very neutral.
* **尽管**: Emphasizes the *freedom* or *extent* of the concession. It hints at "no matter how much X is true..." This aligns with the etymology of `尽` (to the utmost).

### B. Tone Sandhi & Pronunciation
Note that in `尽管`, `尽` is pronounced **jǐn** (3rd tone), meaning "to the greatest extent" (adverbial origin), not *jìn* (4th tone, "to finish/exhaust").
* Common error: Reading it as *jìn*.
* Correct: **jǐn**guǎn.

### C. Collocations
Unlike `虽然`, which pairs broadly, `尽管` pairs particularly well with **还是** (still) in the second clause to emphasize persistence *despite* the obstacle.

> **尽管**由于天气原因航班延误了，我们**还是**准时赶到了会场。
> *Despite the flight delay caused by weather, we still made it to the venue on time.*

## 3. The "Trap": The Adverbial Usage (Feel free to)
This is the most critical distinction for an advanced learner. `尽管` acts as a "Janus word" with two faces based on part of speech.

1. **Conjunction (連词)**: "Although / Even though" (Fact-based, retrospective).
    * *Example:* 尽管很贵…… (Although it is expensive...)
2. **Adverb (副词)**: "Feel free to / Don't hesitate to" (Permission-based, prospective).
    * *Example:* 有问题**尽管**问。 (If you have questions, **feel free to** ask.)

### How to distinguish syntax:
* **Conjunction**: Usually appears at the **start** of the first clause (Topic position).
  * `尽管` + [Subject] + [Verb]...
* **Adverb**: Usually appears directly **before the verb** (VP-modifier position), often in imperative or permissive contexts.
  * [Subject] + `尽管` + [Verb]...

> **Adverbial Example:**
> 你有什么困难**尽管**说，别客气。
> *If you have any difficulties, **don't hesitate to** speak up; don't be polite.*

## 4. Historical/Etymological Note
The word combines **尽** (jǐn - utmost/exhaustively) and **管** (guǎn - to care/manage/mind).

* **Adverbial Logic**: "Exhaustively care about it" → "Go ahead fully; I will manage/care for the consequences" → "Feel free to."
* **Conjunction Logic**: "Let [the situation] be managed/considered to the utmost" → "Even granting X to the fullest extent..." → "Even though."

## 5. Summary Table

| Usage | Part of Speech | Function | Typical Position | Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Even though** | Conjunction | Concession | Clause-initial | 虽然 (suīrán) |
| **Feel free to** | Adverb | Permission | Pre-verbal | 只管 (zhǐguǎn) |

The HSK 5 grammar point specifically targets the **Conjunction** usage, but mastery requires recognizing both.
