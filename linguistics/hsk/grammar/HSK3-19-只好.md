## The Core Concept: "Only Good Option"

**只** (only) + **好** (good).
Literally: "(The) only good (choice is to...)"

It indicates that after considering all options, there is only one feasible path left. It implies reluctance—you don't necessarily *want* to do it, but you *must* because of the situation.

## 1. Reluctant Necessity

**Structure:** `Situation / Reason, (Subject) + 只好 + Verb`

* **雨下得太大，我们只好取消比赛。**
  * *Yǔ xià de tài dà, wǒmen zhǐhǎo qǔxiāo bǐsài.*
  * The rain was too heavy, (so) we **had no choice but to** cancel the match.
* **最后一张票卖完了，我只好明天再来。**
  * *Zuìhòu yì zhāng piào mài wán le, wǒ zhǐhǎo míngtiān zài lái.*
  * The last ticket was sold out, (so) I **have to** come again tomorrow.
* **车坏了，他只好走回家。**
  * *Chē huài le, tā zhǐhǎo zǒu huí jiā.*
  * The car broke down, (so) he **was forced to** walk home.

## Comparison: 只好 (zhǐhǎo) vs. 不得不 (bùdébù)

Both mean "have to" or "no choice but to."

| Word | Tone | Formality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **只好** | Resignation / "Oh well" | Colloquial / Softer. Implies making the best of a bad situation. |
| **不得不** | Compulsion / Strong necessity | More formal / Stronger. Implies external force or logic compels it. "Cannot NOT do it." |

* **只得** (zhǐdé) is a formal version of **只好**.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake:** Using 只好 for happy choices.

* *Error:* 我中了彩票，只好买一辆新车。 (I won the lottery, so I *reluctantly* have to buy a new car.)
* *Correction:* 我中了彩票，**终于可以**买一辆新车。 (I finally can...)

**只好** always implies that the alternative (what you *wanted* to do) is blocked.
