# 以…为… (yǐ...wéi...)

## Core Meaning

**To take [A] as [B]; to regard [A] as [B]; to treat [A] as [B]**

This is a high-frequency formal structure derived directly from Classical
Chinese. It expresses the idea of using A to constitute B, or viewing A in
the role of B.

## Syntactic Structure

> **Subject + 以 + [A] + 为 + [B]**

- **以 (yǐ)**: "Taking", "Using", "By means of" (Instrumental)
- **为 (wéi)**: "To be", "To act as", "To serve as" (Equative/Function)

Literal translation: *"Using A, [one] makes it B."*

## Linguistic Analysis

### 1. The Classical "Instrumental" Construction

In modern Mandarin, we often use **把 (bǎ)** to manipulate objects. In
Classical Chinese, **以 (yǐ)** performed a similar function but focused more
on the *instrument* or *means*.

- **Colloquial/Modern:** **把** 困难 **当做** 挑战。(Take difficulties and
  view them as challenges.)
- **Formal/Literary:** **以** 困难 **为** 挑战。(Take difficulties as
  challenges.)

The **以…为…** structure is the "Prestige Dialect" version of **把…当做…**.
It signals education, formality, and conciseness.

### 2. Information Structure

This structure establishes a **definition** or a **standard**.

- **A** is the topic/material.
- **B** is the category/role assigned to it.

> 我们 **以** 客户满意 **为** 目标。
> (Wǒmen **yǐ** kèhù mǎnyì **wéi** mùbiāo.)
> *We make customer satisfaction our goal.*
> *(Lit: We take customer-satisfaction to be the goal.)*

### 3. "Wéi" as "To Constitute"

The character **为** here is read **wéi** (second tone), meaning "to be" or
"to act as". It is *not* wèi (fourth tone, "for"). It implies a judgment or
an assigned role.

## Common Mistakes & Nuances

### Mistake 1: Confusing with "以为" (yǐwéi)

- **以为 (yǐwéi)**: To think *mistakenly* ("I thought it was X, but it's
  not").
- **以…为…**: To regard A as B (a conscious definition or standard).

> 我 **以为** 你是老师。 (I thought you were a teacher [but maybe you're
> not].)
> 我 **以** 你 **为** 老师。 (I regard you as my teacher [I treat you with
> that respect].)

### Mistake 2: Using Colloquial Nouns in B

The **B** position usually requires an abstract, formal, or categorical noun
(e.g., 本, 主, 荣, 例).

- *Awkward:* 他以那个人为坏蛋。 (He takes that person as a bad egg.) -> Use
  **把…当做…** or **觉得…是…**.
- *Better:* 他以那个人为敌。 (He regards that person as an enemy.)
