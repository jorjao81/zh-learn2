# HSK2 Grammar Point: 老是 (lǎoshì)

## Core Concept: The "Nagging" Always

While dictionaries often translate **老是 (lǎoshì)** simply as "always," "constantly," or "all the time," this gloss misses its primary pragmatic function. **老是** is the adverb of choice for expressing dissatisfaction, annoyance, or resignation regarding a persistent state or recurring action.

If **总是 (zǒngshì)** is the objective observer noting a pattern ("The sun always rises in the east"), **老是** is the subjective participant complaining about it ("Why does it always rain on weekends?").

## Syntactic Structure

**老是** functions as an adverb (副词) modifying the predicate.

**Subject + 老是 + Verb / Adjective Phrase**

It is interchangeable with the monosyllabic **老 (lǎo)** in most colloquial contexts, though **老是** carries slightly more weight due to its bisyllabic nature.

## Pragmatics & Nuance

### 1. The Tone of Complaint (抱怨语气)
The most distinct feature of **老是** is its emotive coloring. It implies that the frequency of the action is excessive, unwanted, or burdensome to the speaker.

* 你**老是**迟到！
    *Nǐ **lǎoshì** chídào!*
    You are **always** late! (Implies: It's annoying/unacceptable.)

* 最近**老是**觉得累。
    *Zuìjìn **lǎoshì** juéde lèi.*
    Recently I **constantly** feel tired. (Implies: It's a dragging, negative state.)

### 2. Subjective vs. Objective Frequency
**老是** describes *subjective* frequency. The action might not happen literally 100% of the time (mathematical "always"), but it happens often enough that the speaker perceives it as a constant, unceasing annoyance.

* 他**老是**向我借钱。
    *Tā **lǎoshì** xiàng wǒ jièqián.*
    He's **forever** borrowing money from me. (He might have only asked three times, but it feels like "always" to the speaker.)

## Comparisons

### 老是 (lǎoshì) vs. 经常 (jīngcháng)

**经常** means "often" (frequency < 100%). **老是** frames the frequency as nearing totality ("all the time") from the speaker's perspective.

* 我们**经常**去那家餐厅。 (We go there often. - Neutral statement of habit)
* 我们**老是**去那家餐厅。 (We go there *all the time*. - Implies we should try somewhere else, or we are in a rut.)
