# HSK3-19 其实 (Actually / In Fact)

## 1. The Core Concept: "Correcting the Record"

**其实** (qíshí) functions as a pivot between *assumption* and *reality*.

Think of it as the "Course Corrector." It signals that what follows is the **truth**, which often contradicts what was just said, what was thought, or what might be expected.

* **Assumption/Appearance:** "Everyone thinks he's rich..."
* **其实 (The Pivot):** "...actually..."
* **Reality:** "...he has a lot of debt."

## 2. Syntax & Usage

**其实** is an adverb, but it often sits at the very beginning of a clause (Topic position) or directly before the subject.

### A. Contra-Expectation (The "But Actually" Usage)

This is the most common use. It politely or directly overturns a misconception.

* 大家都以为他是中国人，**其实**他是韩国人。
    (Dàjiā dōu yǐwéi tā shì Zhōngguó rén, **qíshí** tā shì Hánguó rén.)
  *Everyone assumed he was Chinese, (but) **actually** he is Korean.*

* 这道菜看着很辣，**其实**一点儿也不辣。
    (Zhè dào cài kànzhe hěn là, **qíshí** yìdiǎnr yě bú là.)
  *This dish looks very spicy, (but) **in fact** it's not spicy at all.*

*Note:* You can optionally add **但是/可是** (but) before **其实** for extra emphasis, though **其实** alone often carries the adversative tone.

### B. Softening a Refusal (The "Truth be told" Usage)

When you need to reject an offer or explain a difficulty, **其实** makes it sound less like a whimsical "no" and more like "I'm sharing the objective reality with you."

* A: 你今晚去唱歌吗？ (Are you going specifically to sing tonight?)
* B: 我很想去，**其实**我今晚有很多工作要做。
    (Wǒ hěn xiǎng qù, **qíshí** wǒ jīnwǎn yǒu hěn duō gōngzuò yào zuò.)
  *I'd really like to go, (but) **truth be told**, I have a lot of work tonight.*

## 3. Comparison: 其实 vs. 事实上

Both mean "in fact," but they differ in register and nuance.

| Word | Pinyin | Tone/Register | Usage |
|------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **其实** | qíshí | Conversational / Soft | "Actually..." Corrects misconceptions or reveals hidden thoughts. |
| **事实上** | shìshíshang | Formal / Logical | "As a matter of fact..." Used in arguments, news, or formal writing to present evidence. |

* **其实**我不喜欢吃苹果。 (I actually don't like apples.) -> Personal, revealing.
* **事实上**，经济已经开始复苏。 (As a matter of fact, the economy has started to recover.) -> Objective, reporting.

## 4. Common Pitfalls

### 1. Don't use it for "Current/Now"

In English, "presently" or "currently" can sometimes be confused with "actually" (false friends in some European languages like *actuel*).

* *Wrong:* 我其实在学校。 (Meaning: I am currently at school.)
* *Right:* 我**现在**在学校。 (Wǒ **xiànzài** zài xuéxiào.)

**其实** is *only* for Truth vs. Fiction, not Time.

### 2. Placement

* *Natural:* **其实**我不知道。 / 我**其实**不知道。
* Both are fine. Placing it before the subject emphasizes the whole sentence context. Placing it after the subject (before the verb) emphasizes the action.
