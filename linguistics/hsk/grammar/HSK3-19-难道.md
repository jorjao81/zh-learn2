# HSK3-19 难道 (Don't Tell Me... / Could It Be That...)

## 1. The Core Concept: "Aggressive Incredulity"

**难道** (nándào) marks a **rhetorical question**.

It is not a neutral question. It is a challenge. When you use **难道**, you are indicating that the situation seems unbelievable, absurd, or contrary to logic. You are effectively asking, "Are you seriously telling me that...?" or "Could it possibly be that...?"

The speaker usually expects the answer "No" (if the question is positive) or "Yes" (if the question is negative), but the *feeling* is shock or emphasis.

## 2. Syntax & Usage

*Structure:* `(难道) + Subject + Phrase + 吗/不成?`

**难道** is an adverb, but it often sits at the very start of the sentence for impact.

### A. Expressing Disbelief (The "Don't tell me" usage)

* 都十点了，**难道**你还在睡觉？
    (Dōu shí diǎn le, **nándào** nǐ hái zài shuìjiào?)
  *It's already 10 o'clock; **don't tell me** you are still sleeping?*
  *(Implication: You shouldn't be sleeping!)*

* **难道**你不知道今天是她的生日吗？
    (Nándào nǐ bù zhīdào jīntiān shì tā de shēngrì ma?)
  *Could it be that you **don't** know today is her birthday?*
  *(Implication: Surely you must know! It's obvious!)*

### B. Strengthening a Retort

Used in arguments to point out a contradiction.

* 这是你自己的事情，**难道**要我帮你做吗？
    (Zhè shì nǐ zìjǐ de shìqing, **nándào** yào wǒ bāng nǐ zuò ma?)
  *This is your own business; **do you expect** me to do it for you?*
  *(Implication: Of course I shouldn't have to do it!)*

## 3. The Logical Flip

**难道** typically forces the listener to accept the **opposite** of the literal statement.

* **Literal:** 难道 A 吗？ (Is it possible that A?)
* **Meaning:** Not A. (It definitely shouldn't be A).

* **Literal:** 难道 not A 吗？ (Is it possible that not A?)
* **Meaning:** A. (It definitely is A).

## 4. Collocations

* **难道……吗？** (The standard structure)
* **难道……不成？** (An older, stronger variation, often used in Northern dialects or drama. *Bùchéng* adds "won't do/fail".)
  * *Example:* 你想打架不成？ (Do you want to fight or something?) -> **难道**你想打架不成？

## 5. Comparison: 难道 vs. 真的

* **真的** (Really) is a genuine inquiry or simple surprise.
* **难道** (Could it be) is rhetorical and argumentative.

* A: 他没来。 (He didn't come.)
* B: **真的**吗？ (Really? -> Checking facts)
* B: **难道**他迷路了？ (Could it be that he got lost? -> Speculating on an unlikely cause)
