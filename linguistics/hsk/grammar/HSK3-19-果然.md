# HSK3-19 果然 (Sure Enough / As Expected)

## 1. The Core Concept: "Prediction Verified"

**果然** (guǒrán) is the feeling of a prophecy coming true.

It connects two things:
1. **Prior Knowledge/Prediction:** "I heard it would rain" or "I thought he would be late."
2. **Current Outcome:** "It is raining" or "He is late."

When these two match, you use **果然**. It's the linguistic equivalent of saying, "I knew it!"

## 2. Syntax & Usage

**果然** can appear before the subject or before the verb.

### A. Confirming a Report
* 听说这家饭馆的菜很好吃，我去了一次，味道**果然**不错。
    (Tīngshuō zhè jiā fànguǎn de cài hěn hǎochī, wǒ qù le yí cì, wèidào **guǒrán** búcuò.)
  *I heard this restaurant's food was good; I went once, and **sure enough**, the taste was not bad.*

### B. Confirming a Guess
* 我看天气阴沉沉的，觉得要下雨，过了一会儿，**果然**下起来了。
    (Wǒ kàn tiānqì yīnchénchén de, juéde yào xià yǔ, guò le yíhuìr, **guǒrán** xià qǐlai le.)
  *I saw the weather was gloomy and felt it would rain; after a while, **as expected**, it started raining.*

### C. "If really..." (Conditional Usage - Literary)
In more formal or classical-style contexts, **果然** can mean "if indeed" (if the result is really X).
* 你**果然**爱她，就应该告诉她。
    (Nǐ **guǒrán** ài tā, jiù yīnggāi gàosu tā.)
  *If you **really** love her (as you claim/as it seems), you should tell her.*
  *(Note: This is less common in daily spoken Chinese than the "sure enough" usage.)*

## 3. Comparison: 果然 vs. 竟然

They are opposites in terms of expectation.

| Word | Pinyin | Meaning | Expectation vs. Reality |
|------|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| **果然** | guǒrán | Sure enough | Reality **Matches** Prediction |
| **竟然** | jìngrán | Surprisingly | Reality **Contradicts** Prediction |

* **果然**是他！ (It was him, as expected! -> I suspected him.)
* **竟然**是他！ (It was him, surprisingly! -> I never suspected him.)

## 4. Nuance Note
**果然** is usually neutral or positive, but it can be used for "bad" predictions too ("I knew he would fail"). However, it focuses on the *accuracy of the prediction*, not necessarily the desirability of the event.
