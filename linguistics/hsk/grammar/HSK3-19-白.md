| Mood Adverb | HSK 3 (三19) | 白 | bái | in vain; for nothing; free of charge |

## The Core Concept: "Blank" Results

You likely know **白** (bái) as the color "white." However, linguistically, "white" in Chinese often carries the connotation of "blank," "empty," or "plain."

When used as an adverb before a verb, **白** suggests that the action produced a "blank" result—it was done **in vain** or **for nothing**. The effort was expended, but the expected outcome was not achieved.

A secondary meaning derives from "plain" (without adding anything, like payment)—meaning **for free**.

## 1. Doing Something "In Vain" (Wasted Effort)

This is the most common grammatical usage. It emphasizes the speaker's frustration that an action yielded no results.

**Structure:** `Subject + 白 + Verb + (了)`

* **我今天去也没用，真是白跑一趟。**
  * *Wǒ jīntiān qù yě méiyòng, zhēnshì bái pǎo yí tàng.*
  * Going today was useless; I really made the trip **for nothing**.
* **刚才说的话都白说了，他根本没听进去。**
  * *Gāngcái shuō de huà dōu bái shuō le, tā gēnběn méi tīng jìnqù.*
  * The words I just said were all **in vain**; he didn't listen at all.
* **这种药不管用，钱都白花了。**
  * *Zhè zhǒng yào bù guǎnyòng, qián dōu bái huā le.*
  * This medicine doesn't work; the money was all spent **for nothing**.

### Nuance Note: The use of 了
You will often see **了** after the verb because the realization that the effort was wasted usually happens *after* the action is complete.

## 2. Getting Something "For Free"

Here, "white" means "without compensation" or "gratis." It implies getting something without paying the usual cost (money or effort).

**Structure:** `白 + Verb`

* **天下没有白吃的午餐。**
  * *Tiānxià méiyǒu bái chī de wǔcān.*
  * There is no "free" lunch in this world. (Lit: No lunch eaten **for free**)
* **不管是不是朋友，我也不能白拿你的东西。**
  * *Bùguǎn shìbúshì péngyou, wǒ yě bùnéng bái ná nǐ de dōngxi.*
  * Friend or not, I can't just take your things **for free**.
* **白看** (bái kàn) - To watch for free (e.g., sneaking into a show).

## 3. Idiomatic Usage: "In Vain" vs. "Free"

Context is king.
* **白做** (bái zuò): Usually "did it in vain" (wasted work).
* **白给** (bái gěi): Usually "give for free."

## Comparison: 白 (bái) vs. 免费 (miǎnfèi)

| Word | Part of Speech | Usage | Tone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **免费** | Verb / Adjective | Formal, objective. "Free of charge." | Neutral / Positive |
| **白** | Adverb | Colloquial. "For nothing" or "Without paying." | Can be negative (freeloading) |

* **这个面包是免费的。** (This bread is complimentary/free.) -> Official policy.
* **这个面包是白给的。** (This bread was given for free.) -> Describes the action.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake:** Using 白 to mean "white" in an adverbial position incorrectly.
* *Error:* 他白地跑。 (Trying to use 地 for adverbial marker).
* *Correction:* 他白跑了。 (Direct adverbial modification is standard for single-syllable adverbs like 白).

**Mistake:** Confusing "in vain" with "fake."
* **白** implies the *action* happened but the *result* failed. It does not mean the action didn't happen.
