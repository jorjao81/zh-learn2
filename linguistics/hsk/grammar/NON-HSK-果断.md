# Grammar Point: 果断 (guǒduàn)

| Category | Chinese | Pinyin | Meaning | Part of Speech |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Vocabulary | 果断 | guǒduàn | decisive; resolute; firm | Adjective / Adverb |

## 1. Core Semantics: The Clean Cut

**果断** describes the quality of making decisions quickly, firmly, and without hesitation.

* **Positive Connotation**: Unlike English "hasty" or Chinese **武断** (wǔduàn - arbitrary/rash), `果断` is overwhelmingly positive. It implies wisdom and courage in the face of uncertainty.
* **Logical opposite**: **犹豫** (yóuyù - to hesitate / hesitant).

## 2. Syntactic Roles

As with many Chinese adjectives/stative verbs, `果断` is flexible.

### A. As a Predicate (Adjective)

Used to describe a person's character or a specific action.

> 他处理这件事非常**果断**。
> *Tā chǔlǐ zhè jiàn shì fēicháng guǒduàn.*
> He handled this matter very **decisively**. (Lit: He handling this matter [was] very decisive.)

### B. As an Adverbial Modifier (The "Decisively" Construction)

This is arguably the most productive pattern for learners. When a decision point is reached, one acts `果断`. Note that while `地` (de) can be used (`果断地`), it is frequently omitted in 4-character prosodic chunks or distinct VP structures.

**Structure**: `Subject + (毫不) + 果断 + Verb`

> 看到股票大跌，他**果断**卖出。
> *Seeing the stocks plummet, he **decisively** sold.*
> 面对危险，警察**果断**开枪。
> *Facing danger, the police **resolutely** opened fire.*

### C. Negation: 不够果断 vs. 犹豫不决

You can say someone is `不果断` (not decisive), but often the criticism is softened to `不够果断` (not decisive enough) or synonymous with `优柔寡断` (yōuróuguǎduàn - irresolute/indecisive).

## 3. Important Contrast: 果断 vs. 武断

This is a high-value distinction for advanced usage. Both involve quick decisions, but the *source* and *judgment* differ.

| Word | Pinyin | Meaning | Connotation | Source of Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **果断** | guǒduàn | Decisive | **Positive** (Complimentary) | Courage + Clarity |
| **武断** | wǔduàn | Arbitrary / Dogmatic | **Negative** (Pejorative) | Subjectivity + Lack of Evidence |

> 你这样说太**武断**了。 (Correct)
> *It is too arbitrary/rash for you to say that.* (Implying you lack evidence).
>
> 关键时刻必须**果断**。 (Correct)
> *In critical moments, one must be decisive.*

## 4. Collocations

* **果断放弃** (guǒduàn fàngqì): To decisively give up (cut one's losses).
* **做事果断** (zuòshì guǒduàn): Decisive in handling affairs.
* **杀伐果断** (shāfá guǒduàn): (Idiom, often in literature/media) Decisive in killing/attacking; ruthless but effective (often used for generals or CEOs).
