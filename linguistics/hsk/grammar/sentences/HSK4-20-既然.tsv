既然经理同意了，那我们就马上开始吧。	Jìrán jīnglǐ tóngyì le, nà wǒmen jiù mǎshàng kāishǐ ba.	<span class="hl">Since</span> the manager agreed, let's start immediately.	既然	jìrán	四20	"# HSK4-20 既然 (Since; Given that)

**Pinyin:** jìrán (conjunction)

The core function of **既然 (jìrán)** is to introduce a **factual premise** that is already known or accepted by the listener, serving as the basis for a subsequent suggestion, inference, or decision. It belongs to the category of **causal conjunctions** connecting clauses, but unlike simple ""because"" markers, it emphasizes the *givenness* of the situation—""Given that X is the case, [then] Y.""

## 1. The Logical Structure: ""Given X, then Y""

The standard structure connects two clauses:

> **既然 + [Accepted Fact/Premise], (那/就/那……就……) + [Suggestion/Conclusion]**

* **Clause 1 (Premise):** Specifies a situation that has already happened or is acknowledged as true.
* **Clause 2 (Conclusion):** Offers a logical response to that reality.

Unlike **因为 (yīnwèi)**, which explains *why* something happened (focus on cause), **既然 (jìrán)** focuses on *what to do now* that the situation exists (focus on response/inference).

### Examples

* **既然**你都知道了，我就不多说了。
  * *Jìrán nǐ dōu zhīdào le, wǒ jiù bù duō shuō le.*
  * **Since** you already know everything, I won't say any more.
  * *(Premise: You know. Conclusion: No need for me to talk.)*

* **既然**他不肯来，**那**我们就不勉强他了。
  * *Jìrán tā bù kěn lái, nà wǒmen jiù bù miǎnqiǎng tā le.*
  * **Given that** he's unwilling to come, **then** let's not force him.

* **既然**是你的选择，你**就**要负责到底。
  * *Jìrán shì nǐ de xuǎnzé, nǐ jiù yào fùzé dàodǐ.*
  * **Since** it is your choice, you **must** be responsible to the end.

## 2. Linguistic Nuance: Factuality vs. Causality

It is helpful to contrast **既然 (jìrán)** with **因为 (yīnwèi)**:

* **因为 (yīnwèi)**: Answers ""Why?"" The cause might be new information to the listener.
  * *Context: ""Why aren't you going?""*
  * 因为下雨了。 (Because it's raining.) — *Explaining the reason.*
* **既然 (jìrán)**: Answers ""What now?"" The cause is treated as shared ground.
  * *Context: ""Look, it's raining!""*
  * 既然下雨了，我们就别去了。 (Since/Given that it's raining, let's not go.) — *Deriving a plan from the fact.*

You generally **cannot** answer a ""Why?"" question with 既然.
* Q: 你为什么辞职？ (Why did you resign?)
* A: ❌ **既然**工资太低…… (Incorrect usage)
* A: ✅ **因为**工资太低…… (Correct)

## 3. Collocations and Registers

**既然** is often paired with specific markers in the second clause to signal the result/inference:

* **就 (jiù)**: ""then..."" (most common)
* **也 (yě)**: ""even so..."" / ""also...""
* **还 (hái)**: ""still..."" (often in rhetorical questions)
* **那 (nà) / 那么 (nàme)**: ""in that case...""

### Rhetorical Force
It is frequently used in rhetorical questions (反问句) to challenge illogical behavior:

* **既然**你不喜欢，为什么还要买？
  * *Jìrán nǐ bù xǐhuan, wèishénme hái yào mǎi?*
  * **Since** you don't like it, why are you still buying it?

## 4. ""Just the facts""

The clause following **既然** must be a declarative statement of fact or a conceded point. It cannot be a question or a conjecture about the future (unless that conjecture is treated as a settled assumption).

* ✅ **既然**明天要考试…… (Since [it is a fact that] there is an exam tomorrow...)
* ❌ **既然**明天会不会下雨…… (Incorrect: cannot be a question)

## 5. Common Errors

**Mistake:** Using 既然 for simple causality where inference isn't the point.
* *Bad:* 既然我饿了，我吃了一个苹果。 (Sounds odd: ""Given that I was hungry, I ate an apple."")
* *Better:* 因为我饿了，所以我吃了一个苹果。 (""Because I was hungry, I ate an apple."")
* *Correct 既然 context:* 既然你饿了，这里有个苹果，你拿去吃吧。 (""Since you are hungry [accepted fact], here is an apple, go ahead and eat it."")

**Summary:** **因为** looks backward at the cause; **既然** looks forward to the consequence."	"# Character Breakdown: 既然 (jìrán)

## 既 (jì)
**Core Meaning:** Already; To finish; Since.

* **Etymology:** The ancient form of **既** depicts a person kneeling beside a food vessel (guǐ) with their head turned away/backwards. This vivid imagery suggests someone who has **finished eating** and is turning away from the table.
* **Semantic Evolution:**
  1. Finished eating (original meaning).
  2. Finished / Completed action (generalized).
  3. Already (temporal aspect: the event is done).
  4. Since / Given that (logical aspect: the premise is ""already"" established).

* **Key Compounds:**
  * **既**定 (jìdìng): Already decided / Established (e.g., 既定方针 - established policy).
  * **既**往不咎 (jìwǎngbùjiù): Let bygones be bygones (literally: [regarding] what is **already** past, do not blame).
  * **既**……又…… (jì...yòu...): Both... and... (Literally: [It is] already X, [and] also Y).

## 然 (rán)
**Core Meaning:** Correct; So; Like this; (Suffix for adverbs/adjectives).

* **Etymology:** Originally a pictograph for ""to burn"" (cooking dog meat over fire), which is now written as **燃** (rán). The character was borrowed to serve as a grammatical function word meaning ""yes"", ""correct"", or ""so"".
* **Function in 既然:** Here, **然** functions as a demonstrative pro-form meaning ""so"" or ""like this"" (similar to 这样 or 如此).
* **Logic:**
  * **既** (Already) + **然** (So/Like this)
  * ""It is **already like this**..."" → ""Since this is the case...""

* **Key Compounds:**
  * 自**然** (zìrán): Nature / Natural (Self-so; being so of itself).
  * 当**然** (dāngrán): Of course (Should be so).
  * 虽**然** (suīrán): Although (Even if [it is] so).
  * 不**然** (bùrán): Otherwise (If not so).

The standard structure connects two clauses:

> **既然 + [Accepted Fact/Premise], (那/就/那……就……) + [Suggestion/Conclusion]**

* **Clause 1 (Premise):** Specifies a situation that has already happened or is acknowledged as true.
* **Clause 2 (Conclusion):** Offers a logical response to that reality.

Unlike **因为 (yīnwèi)**, which explains *why* something happened (focus on cause), **既然 (jìrán)** focuses on *what to do now* that the situation exists (focus on response/inference).

### Examples

* **既然**你都知道了，我就不多说了。
  * *Jìrán nǐ dōu zhīdào le, wǒ jiù bù duō shuō le.*
  * **Since** you already know everything, I won't say any more.
  * *(Premise: You know. Conclusion: No need for me to talk.)*

* **既然**他不肯来，**那**我们就不勉强他了。
  * *Jìrán tā bù kěn lái, nà wǒmen jiù bù miǎnqiǎng tā le.*
  * **Given that** he's unwilling to come, **then** let's not force him.

* **既然**是你的选择，你**就**要负责到底。
  * *Jìrán shì nǐ de xuǎnzé, nǐ jiù yào fùzé dàodǐ.*
  * **Since** it is your choice, you **must** be responsible to the end.

## 2. Linguistic Nuance: Factuality vs. Causality

It is helpful to contrast **既然 (jìrán)** with **因为 (yīnwèi)**:

* **因为 (yīnwèi)**: Answers ""Why?"" The cause might be new information to the listener.
  * *Context: ""Why aren't you going?""*
  * 因为下雨了。 (Because it's raining.) — *Explaining the reason.*
* **既然 (jìrán)**: Answers ""What now?"" The cause is treated as shared ground.
  * *Context: ""Look, it's raining!""*
  * 既然下雨了，我们就别去了。 (Since/Given that it's raining, let's not go.) — *Deriving a plan from the fact.*

You generally **cannot** answer a ""Why?"" question with 既然.
* Q: 你为什么辞职？ (Why did you resign?)
* A: ❌ **既然**工资太低…… (Incorrect usage)
* A: ✅ **因为**工资太低…… (Correct)

## 3. Collocations and Registers

**既然** is often paired with specific markers in the second clause to signal the result/inference:

* **就 (jiù)**: ""then..."" (most common)
* **也 (yě)**: ""even so..."" / ""also...""
* **还 (hái)**: ""still..."" (often in rhetorical questions)
* **那 (nà) / 那么 (nàme)**: ""in that case...""

### Rhetorical Force
It is frequently used in rhetorical questions (反问句) to challenge illogical behavior:

* **既然**你不喜欢，为什么还要买？
  * *Jìrán nǐ bù xǐhuan, wèishénme hái yào mǎi?*
  * **Since** you don't like it, why are you still buying it?

## 4. ""Just the facts""

The clause following **既然** must be a declarative statement of fact or a conceded point. It cannot be a question or a conjecture about the future (unless that conjecture is treated as a settled assumption).

* ✅ **既然**明天要考试…… (Since [it is a fact that] there is an exam tomorrow...)
* ❌ **既然**明天会不会下雨…… (Incorrect: cannot be a question)

## 5. Common Errors

**Mistake:** Using 既然 for simple causality where inference isn't the point.
* *Bad:* 既然我饿了，我吃了一个苹果。 (Sounds odd: ""Given that I was hungry, I ate an apple."")
* *Better:* 因为我饿了，所以我吃了一个苹果。 (""Because I was hungry, I ate an apple."")
* *Correct 既然 context:* 既然你饿了，这里有个苹果，你拿去吃吧。 (""Since you are hungry [accepted fact], here is an apple, go ahead and eat it."")

**Summary:** **因为** looks backward at the cause; **既然** looks forward to the consequence."	"# Character Breakdown: 既然 (jìrán)

## 既 (jì)
**Core Meaning:** Already; To finish; Since.

* **Etymology:** The ancient form of **既** depicts a person kneeling beside a food vessel (guǐ) with their head turned away/backwards. This vivid imagery suggests someone who has **finished eating** and is turning away from the table.
* **Semantic Evolution:**
  1. Finished eating (original meaning).
  2. Finished / Completed action (generalized).
  3. Already (temporal aspect: the event is done).
  4. Since / Given that (logical aspect: the premise is ""already"" established).

* **Key Compounds:**
  * **既**定 (jìdìng): Already decided / Established (e.g., 既定方针 - established policy).
  * **既**往不咎 (jìwǎngbùjiù): Let bygones be bygones (literally: [regarding] what is **already** past, do not blame).
  * **既**……又…… (jì...yòu...): Both... and... (Literally: [It is] already X, [and] also Y).

## 然 (rán)
**Core Meaning:** Correct; So; Like this; (Suffix for adverbs/adjectives).

* **Etymology:** Originally a pictograph for ""to burn"" (cooking dog meat over fire), which is now written as **燃** (rán). The character was borrowed to serve as a grammatical function word meaning ""yes"", ""correct"", or ""so"".
* **Function in 既然:** Here, **然** functions as a demonstrative pro-form meaning ""so"" or ""like this"" (similar to 这样 or 如此).
* **Logic:**
  * **既** (Already) + **然** (So/Like this)
  * ""It is **already like this**..."" → ""Since this is the case...""

* **Key Compounds:**
  * 自**然** (zìrán): Nature / Natural (Self-so; being so of itself).
  * 当**然** (dāngrán): Of course (Should be so).
  * 虽**然** (suīrán): Although (Even if [it is] so).
  * 不**然** (bùrán): Otherwise (If not so).

## Synthesis: 既然
When you say **既然 (jìrán)**, you are literally saying: **""[The situation] being already so...""** or **""[Since it is] already like this...""**

This etymology explains why **既然** is used to introduce an **accepted fact**. You aren't introducing new information; you are pointing to a situation that is ""already so"" (finished/established) and using it as a stepping stone for your next point."	grammar::四20 word::既然
