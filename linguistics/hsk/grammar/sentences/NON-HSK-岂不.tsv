你若不解释清楚，他<span class="hl">岂不</span>会误会？	Nǐ ruò bù jiěshì qīngchu, tā qǐbù huì wùhuì?	If you don't explain clearly, <span class="hl">wouldn't</span> he misunderstand?	岂不	qǐbù	NON-HSK	"# 岂不 (qǐbù)

## Core Concept

**岂不** (qǐbù) is a high-register rhetorical question marker used to assert that a proposition is obviously true by asking, ""How is it not...?"" or ""Wouldn't that be...?""

It functions as a **strong affirmative** disguised as a negative question. It sits at the intersection of modality and negation, often conveying a tone of logical inevitability or urging the listener to agree with a self-evident conclusion.

## Linguistic Mechanism

### 1. The Particle 岂 (qǐ)

In Classical Chinese, _qǐ_ (岂) serves as a modal particle indicating a rhetorical question (making it a functional equivalent to ""how could"" or ""how""). It fundamentally challenges the predicate.

### 2. Double Negation Logic

When combined with the negator _bù_ (不), the structure literally asks ""How [is it] not [X]?""

- _Assumption:_ P is true.
- _Challenge:_ Can you demonstrate that P is not true? (Implied: No.)
- _Result:_ P is emphatically true.

This follows the standard linguistic principle where a negative rhetorical question implies a positive assertion.

## Usage & Syntax

**Structure:** `Subject (optional) + 岂不 + Predicate (Verb/Adj) + ... ?`

Unlike _nándào_ (难道), which often expresses shock, disbelief, or an attempt to refute (""Do you mean to say...?""), _qǐbù_ typically highlights **desirability** or **logical consequence**. It often appears in contexts suggesting that a certain outcome is perfect, ideal, or logical.

### Common Collocations

It frequently precedes adjectives or verbs denoting positive states or simple facts.

- **岂不更好?** (qǐbù gèng hǎo) — Wouldn't that be even better?
- **岂不快哉?** (qǐbù kuài zāi) — Wouldn't that be delightful? (High literary flavor)
- **岂不美哉?** (qǐbù měi zāi) — Wouldn't that be beautiful/perfect?

## Examples

### 1. Suggesting an ideal solution (Logical Consequence)

> 既省钱又省力，**岂不**两全其美？
> _Jì shěngqián yòu shěnglì, **qǐbù** liǎngquánqíměi?_
> It saves both money and effort; **wouldn't that be** the best of both worlds?
> _(Implication: It obviously is the best of both worlds.)_

### 2. Pointing out the irony or obviousness

> 如果我们现在放弃，以前的努力**岂不**白费了？
> _Rúguǒ wǒmen xiànzài fàngqì, yǐqián de nǔlì **qǐbù** báifèi le?_
> If we give up now, **wouldn't** our previous efforts have been in vain?
> _(Implication: They certainly would be wasted, so we must not give up.)_

## Comparison: 岂不 vs. 难道

| Feature      | 岂不 (qǐbù)                    | 难道 (nándào)                            |
| :----------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Tone**     | Assertive, Logical, Suggestive | Disbelieving, Shocked, Refuting          |
| **Register** | Formal, Literary (书面语)      | Neutral, Spoken or Written               |
| **Function** | ""Isn't it obviously X?""        | ""Could it possibly be X?"" (Expects 'No') |
| **Pattern**  | Often `岂不...吗/哉`           | Often `难道...吗/不成`                   |

- **Example A (难道):** 难道你不知道？ (Don't tell me you didn't know? / Could it be that you didn't know?) — _Focus on disbelief._
- **Example B (岂不):** 这样岂不更好？ (Wouldn't this be better?) — _Focus on confirming a fact._

## Pragmatics

You will encounter _qǐbù_ mostly in:

1. **Formal writing/speech:** Editorials, speeches, essays.
2. **Historical dramas (Guzhuang):** Characters speaking in a semi-classical style.
3. **Fixed idioms:** Like _qǐbù měi zāi_ (retained from Classical Chinese).

It is generally not used in casual, daily conversation to ask simple questions (e.g., you wouldn't say ""Weather qǐbù hot?"" to mean ""Isn't it hot?"")."	"# Character Breakdown: 岂不 (qǐbù)

## 岂 (qǐ)

* **Pinyin:** qǐ
* **Meaning:** How? / (Rhetorical question particle)
* **Structure:**
  * Traditional: 豈
  * Simplified: 岂

### Etymology
The Traditional character **豈** is a phonosemantic compound.
* **Semantic:** 豆 (dòu) - originally a vessel or standing drum.
* The character originally depicted a triumphant return of an army, involving beating drums (hence the component). It was borrowed early on for the sound *qǐ* to represent the abstract grammatical particle ""how"" (modal particle).

In Simplified Chinese, it was reduced to **岂** (`山` + `己`), which is based on a cursive script form and loses the visual connection to the ""drum/vessel"" etymology.

### Key Compounds
* **岂有此理** (qǐyǒucǐlǐ): ""How can there be such a reason?"" -> Preposterous! Outrageous!
* **岂敢** (qǐgǎn): ""How would I dare?"" (A humble refusal of praise or honor).

## 不 (bù)

* **Pinyin:** bù
* **Meaning:** No / Not
* **Tone Sandhi:**
  * Pronounced **bù** (4th tone) by default.
  * Pronounced **bú** (2nd tone) before another 4th tone syllable.
  * *Note:* In *qǐbù*, if the following word is 4th tone (e.g., *qǐbù kuài...*), *bù* shifts to *bú*. If it stands alone or precedes other tones, it remains *bù*.

### Etymology
The character **不** originally depicted the calyx of a flower or a root system. It was borrowed for its sound to represent the negative particle. It is one of the most fundamental grammatical markers in the language."	grammar::NON-HSK word::岂不

## Pragmatics

You will encounter _qǐbù_ mostly in:

1. **Formal writing/speech:** Editorials, speeches, essays.
2. **Historical dramas (Guzhuang):** Characters speaking in a semi-classical style.
3. **Fixed idioms:** Like _qǐbù měi zāi_ (retained from Classical Chinese).

It is generally not used in casual, daily conversation to ask simple questions (e.g., you wouldn't say ""Weather qǐbù hot?"" to mean ""Isn't it hot?"")."	"# Character Breakdown: 岂不 (qǐbù)

## 岂 (qǐ)

* **Pinyin:** qǐ
* **Meaning:** How? / (Rhetorical question particle)
* **Structure:**
  * Traditional: 豈
  * Simplified: 岂

### Etymology
The Traditional character **豈** is a phonosemantic compound.
* **Semantic:** 豆 (dòu) - originally a vessel or standing drum.
* The character originally depicted a triumphant return of an army, involving beating drums (hence the component). It was borrowed early on for the sound *qǐ* to represent the abstract grammatical particle ""how"" (modal particle).

In Simplified Chinese, it was reduced to **岂** (`山` + `己`), which is based on a cursive script form and loses the visual connection to the ""drum/vessel"" etymology.

### Key Compounds
* **岂有此理** (qǐyǒucǐlǐ): ""How can there be such a reason?"" -> Preposterous! Outrageous!
* **岂敢** (qǐgǎn): ""How would I dare?"" (A humble refusal of praise or honor).

## 不 (bù)

* **Pinyin:** bù
* **Meaning:** No / Not
* **Tone Sandhi:**
  * Pronounced **bù** (4th tone) by default.
  * Pronounced **bú** (2nd tone) before another 4th tone syllable.
  * *Note:* In *qǐbù*, if the following word is 4th tone (e.g., *qǐbù kuài...*), *bù* shifts to *bú*. If it stands alone or precedes other tones, it remains *bù*.

### Etymology
The character **不** originally depicted the calyx of a flower or a root system. It was borrowed for its sound to represent the negative particle. It is one of the most fundamental grammatical markers in the language."	grammar::NON-HSK word::岂不
