"他说今天会来，下午<span class=""hl"">果然</span>来了。"	"He said he would come today, and in the afternoon he <span class=""hl"">sure enough</span> came."	果然	guǒrán	HSK3-19	"# HSK3-19 果然 (Sure Enough / As Expected)

## 1. The Core Concept: ""Prediction Verified""

**果然** (guǒrán) is the feeling of a prophecy coming true.

It connects two things:
1.  **Prior Knowledge/Prediction:** ""I heard it would rain"" or ""I thought he would be late.""
2.  **Current Outcome:** ""It is raining"" or ""He is late.""

When these two match, you use **果然**. It's the linguistic equivalent of saying, ""I knew it!""

## 2. Syntax & Usage

**果然** can appear before the subject or before the verb.

### A. Confirming a Report
*   听说这家饭馆的菜很好吃，我去了一次，味道**果然**不错。
    (Tīngshuō zhè jiā fànguǎn de cài hěn hǎochī, wǒ qù le yí cì, wèidào **guǒrán** búcuò.)
    *I heard this restaurant's food was good; I went once, and **sure enough**, the taste was not bad.*

### B. Confirming a Guess
*   我看天气阴沉沉的，觉得要下雨，过了一会儿，**果然**下起来了。
    (Wǒ kàn tiānqì yīnchénchén de, juéde yào xià yǔ, guò le yíhuìr, **guǒrán** xià qǐlai le.)
    *I saw the weather was gloomy and felt it would rain; after a while, **as expected**, it started raining.*

### C. ""If really..."" (Conditional Usage - Literary)
In more formal or classical-style contexts, **果然** can mean ""if indeed"" (if the result is really X).
*   你**果然**爱她，就应该告诉她。
    (Nǐ **guǒrán** ài tā, jiù yīnggāi gàosu tā.)
    *If you **really** love her (as you claim/as it seems), you should tell her.*
    *(Note: This is less common in daily spoken Chinese than the ""sure enough"" usage.)*

## 3. Comparison: 果然 vs. 竟然

They are opposites in terms of expectation.

## 4. Nuance Note
**果然** is usually neutral or positive, but it can be used for ""bad"" predictions too (""I knew he would fail""). However, it focuses on the *accuracy of the prediction*, not necessarily the desirability of the event."	"**果** (guǒ): fruit / result / determined
- **Etymology**: A tree with round fruits on top.
- **Meaning**: ""Fruit"" implies the end product or the result. Hence **结果** (result), **后果** (consequence).
