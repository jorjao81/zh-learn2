"他表面上很凶，<span class=""hl"">其实</span>心里很善良。"	"He appears fierce on the surface, but <span class=""hl"">actually</span> he is kind-hearted inside."	其实	qíshí	HSK3-19	"# HSK3-19 其实 (Actually / In Fact)

## 1. The Core Concept: ""Correcting the Record""

**其实** (qíshí) functions as a pivot between *assumption* and *reality*.

Think of it as the ""Course Corrector."" It signals that what follows is the **truth**, which often contradicts what was just said, what was thought, or what might be expected.

*   **Assumption/Appearance:** ""Everyone thinks he's rich...""
*   **其实 (The Pivot):** ""...actually...""
*   **Reality:** ""...he has a lot of debt.""

## 2. Syntax & Usage

**其实** is an adverb, but it often sits at the very beginning of a clause (Topic position) or directly before the subject.

### A. Contra-Expectation (The ""But Actually"" Usage)
This is the most common use. It politely or directly overturns a misconception.

*   大家都以为他是中国人，**其实**他是韩国人。
    (Dàjiā dōu yǐwéi tā shì Zhōngguó rén, **qíshí** tā shì Hánguó rén.)
    *Everyone assumed he was Chinese, (but) **actually** he is Korean.*

*   这道菜看着很辣，**其实**一点儿也不辣。
    (Zhè dào cài kànzhe hěn là, **qíshí** yìdiǎnr yě bú là.)
    *This dish looks very spicy, (but) **in fact** it's not spicy at all.*

*Note:* You can optionally add **但是/可是** (but) before **其实** for extra emphasis, though **其实** alone often carries the adversative tone.

### B. Softening a Refusal (The ""Truth be told"" Usage)
When you need to reject an offer or explain a difficulty, **其实** makes it sound less like a whimsical ""no"" and more like ""I'm sharing the objective reality with you.""

*   A: 你今晚去唱歌吗？ (Are you going specifically to sing tonight?)
*   B: 我很想去，**其实**我今晚有很多工作要做。
    (Wǒ hěn xiǎng qù, **qíshí** wǒ jīnwǎn yǒu hěn duō gōngzuò yào zuò.)
    *I'd really like to go, (but) **truth be told**, I have a lot of work tonight.*

## 3. Comparison: 其实 vs. 事实上

Both mean ""in fact,"" but they differ in register and nuance.

| Word | Pinyin | Tone/Register | Usage |
|------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **其实** | qíshí | Conversational / Soft | ""Actually..."" Corrects misconceptions or reveals hidden thoughts. |
| **事实上** | shìshíshang | Formal / Logical | ""As a matter of fact..."" Used in arguments, news, or formal writing to present evidence. |

*   **其实**我不喜欢吃苹果。 (I actually don't like apples.) -> Personal, revealing.
*   **事实上**，经济已经开始复苏。 (As a matter of fact, the economy has started to recover.) -> Objective, reporting.

## 4. Common Pitfalls

**1. Don't use it for ""Current/Now""**
In English, ""presently"" or ""currently"" can sometimes be confused with ""actually"" (false friends in some European languages like *actuel*).
*   *Wrong:* 我其实在学校。 (Meaning: I am currently at school.)
*   *Right:* 我**现在**在学校。 (Wǒ **xiànzài** zài xuéxiào.)

**其实** is *only* for Truth vs. Fiction, not Time.
