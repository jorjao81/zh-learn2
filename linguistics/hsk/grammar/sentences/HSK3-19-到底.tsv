## The Core Concept: ""To the Bottom""

**到** (arrive) + **底** (bottom).
Literally: ""Arriving at the very bottom.""

This core image explains its three main usages:
1. **Questioning:** Digging to the bottom of a mystery (""What *on earth*...?"").
2. **Concluding:** Reaching the fundamental truth (""After all..."").
3. **Action:** Doing something thoroughly (""To the end"").

## 1. In Questions: ""On Earth"" / ""The Hell""

Used to press for an answer or express impatience. It demands the ""bottom line"" truth.

**Structure:** `Subject + 到底 + Question Phrase`

* **你到底去不去？**
  * *Nǐ dàodǐ qù bú qù?*
  * Are you going or not, **after all**? (Make up your mind!)
* **他到底想说什么？**
  * *Tā dàodǐ xiǎng shuō shénme?*
  * What **on earth** does he want to say?
* **这到底是怎么回事？**
  * *Zhè dàodǐ shì zěnme huí shì?*
  * What **the heck** is going on here?

## 2. In Statements: ""After all"" / ""Finally""

Used to emphasize a result reached after a long process, or a fundamental fact that cannot be ignored.

### A. Finally (Result)
* **经过三次尝试，他到底成功了。**
  * *Jīngguò sāncì chángshì, tā dàodǐ chénggōng le.*
  * After three attempts, he **finally** succeeded.
  * *(Similar to 终于 - zhōngyú)*

### B. After All (Fundamental Fact)
* **他到底是孩子，别对他太严格。**
  * *Tā dàodǐ shì háizi, bié duì tā tài yángé.*
  * He is a child **after all**, don't be too strict with him.
  * *(Also: 毕竟 - bìjìng)*

## 3. Verb Phrase: ""To the End""

Here it is not an adverb, but a verb + complement structure.

* **坚持到底**
  * *Jiānchí dàodǐ*
  * Persist **to the end**.
* **进行到底**
  * *Jìnxíng dàodǐ*
  * Carry on **to the end**.

## Comparison: 到底 (dàodǐ) vs. 终于 (zhōngyú)

| Word | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **终于** | Focuses on the **result** after a long time. Usually positive outcome. ""Finally!"" |
| **到底** | Can mean ""finally"" (result), but also ""on earth"" (question) and ""after all"" (nature). |

* *Question:* 你**到底**去哪儿？ (Where on earth are you going?) -> **终于** cannot be used here.
* *Result:* 飞机**终于**起飞了。 (The plane finally took off.) -> **到底** can be used, but **终于** is more common for simple elapsed time.

## Comparison: 到底 (dàodǐ) vs. 毕竟 (bìjìng)

| Word | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **毕竟** | ""After all."" Used for reasoning/excuses. ""He is, after all, young."" |
| **到底** | Can also mean ""After all"" in this sense. |

* 他**毕竟/到底**是我的弟弟。 (He is my brother, after all.) -> Both work.

## Compound Breakdown: Arrive + Bottom

### 1. 到 (dào) - To Arrive / To
* **Meaning:** To arrive, to go to, to reach.
* **Direction:** Indicates movement towards a destination or state.

### 2. 底 (dǐ) - Bottom / Base
* **Visual:** Under a shelter (广), something low (氐).
* **Meaning:** The bottom of an object, the base, the end of a period (e.g., end of the year 年底).
* **Common Words:**
  * **海底** (hǎidǐ) - Seabed.
  * **年底** (niándǐ) - End of year.
  * **彻底** (chèdǐ) - Thorough (penetrate to the bottom).

### The Combination: 到底 (dàodǐ)
Literally ""Arrive at the bottom.""

The transition from spatial to abstract meaning is logical:
1. **Spatial:** Going to the bottom (of a hole/sea).
2. **Temporal:** Going to the end (persist to the end).
3. **Inquisitive:** Digging to the root of a question (What *on earth* is the answer?).
4. **Logical:** Reaching the fundamental truth (He is a child *at the bottom* / after all).

2. **Temporal:** Going to the end (persist to the end).
3. **Inquisitive:** Digging to the root of a question (What *on earth* is the answer?).
4. **Logical:** Reaching the fundamental truth (He is a child *at the bottom* / after all).

## The Core Concept: ""To the Bottom""

**到** (arrive) + **底** (bottom).
Literally: ""Arriving at the very bottom.""

This core image explains its three main usages:
1. **Questioning:** Digging to the bottom of a mystery (""What *on earth*...?"").
2. **Concluding:** Reaching the fundamental truth (""After all..."").
3. **Action:** Doing something thoroughly (""To the end"").

## 1. In Questions: ""On Earth"" / ""The Hell""

Used to press for an answer or express impatience. It demands the ""bottom line"" truth.

**Structure:** `Subject + 到底 + Question Phrase`

* **你到底去不去？**
  * *Nǐ dàodǐ qù bú qù?*
  * Are you going or not, **after all**? (Make up your mind!)
* **他到底想说什么？**
  * *Tā dàodǐ xiǎng shuō shénme?*
  * What **on earth** does he want to say?
* **这到底是怎么回事？**
  * *Zhè dàodǐ shì zěnme huí shì?*
  * What **the heck** is going on here?

## 2. In Statements: ""After all"" / ""Finally""

Used to emphasize a result reached after a long process, or a fundamental fact that cannot be ignored.

### A. Finally (Result)
* **经过三次尝试，他到底成功了。**
  * *Jīngguò sāncì chángshì, tā dàodǐ chénggōng le.*
  * After three attempts, he **finally** succeeded.
  * *(Similar to 终于 - zhōngyú)*

### B. After All (Fundamental Fact)
* **他到底是孩子，别对他太严格。**
  * *Tā dàodǐ shì háizi, bié duì tā tài yángé.*
  * He is a child **after all**, don't be too strict with him.
  * *(Also: 毕竟 - bìjìng)*

## 3. Verb Phrase: ""To the End""

Here it is not an adverb, but a verb + complement structure.

* **坚持到底**
  * *Jiānchí dàodǐ*
  * Persist **to the end**.
* **进行到底**
  * *Jìnxíng dàodǐ*
  * Carry on **to the end**.

## Comparison: 到底 (dàodǐ) vs. 终于 (zhōngyú)

| Word | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **终于** | Focuses on the **result** after a long time. Usually positive outcome. ""Finally!"" |
| **到底** | Can mean ""finally"" (result), but also ""on earth"" (question) and ""after all"" (nature). |

* *Result:* 飞机**终于**起飞了。 (The plane finally took off.) -> **到底** can be used, but **终于** is more common for simple elapsed time.

## Comparison: 到底 (dàodǐ) vs. 毕竟 (bìjìng)
