"这个问题<span class=""hl"">确实</span>很复杂，我们得好好研究一下。"	"This problem is <span class=""hl"">indeed</span> very complex; we need to study it carefully."	确实	quèshí	HSK3-19	"# HSK3-19 确实 (Indeed / Truly)

## 1. The Core Concept: ""Validation""

**确实** (quèshí) is an adverb of **confirmation**. It affirms that a statement, an observation, or a reputation is objectively true.

While **其实** (qíshí) says ""You thought X, but it's Y,"" **确实** says ""You thought X, and yes, it really is X.""

*   It validates objective facts.
*   It agrees with previous speakers.
*   It emphasizes sincerity.

## 2. Syntax & Usage

*Structure:* `Subject + 确实 + Adjective/Verb`

### A. Confirming a Fact (Objective)
*   这里的风景**确实**很漂亮。
    (Zhèlǐ de fēngjǐng **quèshí** hěn piàoliang.)
    *The scenery here is **indeed** very beautiful.*
    *(Context: Everyone says it's beautiful, or I am seeing it now and confirming it.)*

### B. Agreeing with Someone (In Dialogue)
*   A: 这个句子很难懂。 (This sentence is hard to understand.)
*   B: **确实**很难。 (It is **indeed** very hard.)

### C. Adjectival Use (Reliable/True)
Unlike many adverbs, **确实** can occasionally function as an adjective meaning ""reliable"" or ""true.""
*   这个消息**确实**吗？
    (Zhè ge xiāoxi **quèshí** ma?)
    *Is this news **reliable/true**?*
