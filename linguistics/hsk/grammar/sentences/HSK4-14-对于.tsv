<span class="hl">对于</span>这个问题，我有不同的看法。	Duìyú zhège wèntí, wǒ yǒu bùtóng de kànfǎ.	<span class="hl">Regarding</span> this problem, I have a different view.	对于	duìyú	四14	"In Chinese linguistics, **对于 (duìyú)** is categorized as a **preposition (介词 - jiècí)**. It is primarily used to introduce the object, person, or situation toward which an action is directed or an attitude is held.

---

### 1. Core Function
**对于** introduces the ""target"" (对象 - duìxiàng) or the ""scope"" (范围 - fànwéi) of a viewpoint, treatment, or state of affairs. It effectively sets the stage by highlighting what the following statement is ""about.""

### 2. Sentence Structures

#### A. At the beginning of a sentence (Topic-Fronting)
When placed at the start, it serves to define the topic clearly before the main clause.
> **对于 + Object, Subject + Verb/Attitude.**
>
> * **对于**这个问题，我有不同的看法。
> * *(Regarding this problem, I have a different view.)*

#### B. After the subject
It can also be placed between the subject and the predicate to specify the target of the subject's action or feeling.
> **Subject + 对于 + Object + Verb/Attitude.**
>
> * 老师**对于**每个学生都很关心。
> * *(The teacher is very concerned regarding every student.)*

---

### 3. Linguistic Distinctions: 对于 vs. 对

While **对于** and **对 (duì)** are often interchangeable when meaning ""regarding,"" there are critical linguistic boundaries to observe:

1. **Formality:** **对于** is more formal and is more frequently found in written Chinese or formal speeches. **对** is more versatile and common in daily conversation.
2. **Breadth of Meaning:** **对** has a much wider range of uses. It can indicate direction (toward), a direct action between people, or ""to/for."" **对于** is strictly limited to ""regarding/concerning.""
3. **Incompatibility in Direct Action:** If the sentence describes a direct action from one person to another (like ""speaking to someone""), you **must** use **对**, not **对于**.
    * *Correct:* 我**对**他说过这件事。 (I spoke to him about this.)
    * *Incorrect:* 我~~对于~~他说过这件事。

---

### 4. Examples in Context

* **对于**这件往事，他已经忘得差不多了。
  * *(Regarding this past event, he has almost forgotten it all.)*
* 我们**对于**环境污染问题必须引起重视。
  * *(We must pay serious attention regarding the issue of environmental pollution.)*
* **对于**新来的同事，我们要热烈欢迎。
  * *(Regarding the newly arrived colleagues, we should give a warm welcome.)*

### Summary for the Learner
