| Category | Level | Character | Pinyin | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mood Adverb / Noun | HSK 3 (三19) | 根本 | gēnběn | at all; simply; fundamentally; root |

## The Core Concept: ""Root & Stem"" -> ""Foundation""

**根本** (gēnběn) refers to the roots of a plant.
* **Noun:** The foundation, the base.
* **Adverb:** ""From the root,"" ""Fundamentally,"" or (with negatives) ""Not even at the root"" -> **Not at all**.

## 1. Emphatic Negative: ""Not at all""

This is the most frequent conversational usage. It emphasizes that something is completely untrue or impossible, right from the start.

**Structure:** `Subject + 根本 + 不/没(有) + Verb/Adj`

* **我根本不认识他。**
  * *Wǒ gēnběn bú rènshi tā.*
  * I don't know him **at all**. (It's not that I know him a little; I have zero knowledge of him).
* **他根本没去过北京。**
  * *Tā gēnběn méi qùguo Běijīng.*
  * He has **never even** been to Beijing (contrary to what you might think).
* **这个问题根本解决不了。**
  * *Zhège wèntí gēnběn jiějué bùliǎo.*
  * This problem **simply** cannot be solved.

## 2. Fundamental / Basic (Adjective/Noun)

Used to describe the root cause or essential nature of something.

* **这是最根本的原因。**
  * *Zhè shì zuì gēnběn de yuányīn.*
  * This is the most **fundamental** reason.
* **我们需要从根本上解决问题。**
  * *Wǒmen xūyào cóng gēnběn shang jiějué wèntí.*
  * We need to solve the problem from the **root**.

## Comparison: 根本 (gēnběn) vs. 完全 (wánquán)

Both can mean ""completely.""

| Word | Nuance | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **完全** | ""Wholly / Entirely"" | Focuses on *completeness* (100%). Used with positives and negatives. |
| **根本** | ""Radically / At the root"" | Focuses on *emphasis*. Almost exclusively used with **negatives** in spoken Chinese (""not at all""). |

* **我完全同意。** (I completely agree.) -> Positive usage. **根本** is rarely used here (""我根本同意"" sounds weird/wrong unless emphasizing ""fundamentally"").
* **我完全不同意** vs **我根本不同意** -> Both mean ""I totally disagree,"" but **根本** feels more dismissive (""I disagree from the root"").
"	"# Character: 根本 (gēnběn)

## Compound Breakdown: Root + Stem

### 1. 根 (gēn) - Root
* **Radical:** 木 (Tree/Wood).
* **Meaning:** The root of a plant.
* **Extensions:**
  * Root / Source / Origin.
  * Measure word for long, thin objects (like sticks, hairs, cigarettes).
  * **树根** (shùgēn) - Tree root.
  * **根据** (gēnjù) - According to (Based on the root/foundation).

### 2. 本 (běn) - Stem / Root / Book
* **Radical:** 木 (Tree) with a line indicating the base/root.
* **Meaning:**
  * Root / Stem.
  * Foundation / Basis.
  * Book (originally bamboo slips bound together).
  * Measure word for books.
  * **本来** (běnlái) - Originally.
  * **日本** (Rìběn) - Japan (Root of the Sun = Land of the Rising Sun).

### The Combination: 根本 (gēnběn)
Literally ""Root + Root/Stem.""
It reinforces the idea of the absolute foundation.

* If you say ""I **根本** don't know,"" you are saying ""From the very foundation/root, I do not know."" It eradicates the possibility completely.
