# HSK 4 Grammar: 可见 (kějiàn)

## 1. The Core Concept: "Evidential Inference"

The conjunction **可见** (kějiàn) connects a **fact** to a **conclusion**.

Literally composed of **可** (can) + **见** (see), it means "it can be seen that..." or "it is clear that...".

Unlike generic "therefore" words, **可见** emphasizes that the second clause is a subjective **inference** or **deduction** made by the speaker based on the evidence presented in the first clause.

### The Logic flow

1. **Clause A**: The Visible Evidence (Fact)
2. **可见**: "From this evidence, we can infer..."
3. **Clause B**: The Hidden Truth (Conclusion)

> **Formula:** [ Evidence / Fact ], **可见** [ Inference / Judgment ]

## 2. Examples

### Basic Inference

Evidence: He has lived in China for 10 years.
Conclusion: His Chinese must be very good.

* 他都在中国住十年了，**可见**他的汉语一定很地道。
  * *Tā dōu zài Zhōngguó zhù shí nián le, **kějiàn** tā de Hànyǔ yīdìng hěn dìdao.*
  * (He's lived in China for 10 years; **it is clear that** his Chinese must be very authentic.)

### Inferring Quality/Character

Evidence: He helps me whenever I'm in trouble.
Conclusion: He is a true friend.

* 他在我困难的时候一直帮助我，**可见**他对我是真心的。
  * *Tā zài wǒ kùnnan de shíhou yīzhí bāngzhù wǒ, **kějiàn** tā duì wǒ shì zhēnxīn de.*
  * (He always helps me when I'm in trouble; **this shows that** he is sincere towards me.)

## 3. Linguistic Analysis

### A. Comparison: 可见 vs. 所以 (suǒyǐ)

* **所以 (so/therefore)**: Indicates a simple **result** or **consequence**. The result might be a physical action.
* **可见 (it is clear that)**: Indicates a **mental deduction**. The result is a realization or judgment.

**Scenario:** You are hungry.

1. 我饿了，**所以**我吃饭了。 (Correct)
    * *I was hungry, **so** I ate.* (Cause $ o$ Action)
2. ❌ 我饿了，**可见**我吃饭了。 (Wrong)
    * *I was hungry, **it can be seen that** I ate.* (Nonsense. Eating is an action, not a hidden truth revealed by hunger.)
3. 他一口气吃了三个汉堡，**可见**他饿坏了。 (Correct)
    * *He ate three burgers in one breath; **it is obvious that** he was starving.* (Action $ o$ Deduction about his state.)

### B. Variations: 由此可见 & 足见

#### 由此可见 (yóucǐ kějiàn)

This is a more formal, four-character version often used in writing, speeches, or debates.

* **由此** (yóucǐ) = "From this..."
* **可见** (kějiàn) = "...it can be seen"

> **由此可见**，环保问题已经刻不容缓。
> *From this we can see that the environmental issue usually brooks no delay.*

#### 足见 (zújiàn)

Listed alongside **可见** in HSK 4, this means "Suffices to show" or "Is enough to prove". It is stronger and more emphatic.

* **足** (zú) = Sufficient / Enough
* **见** (jiàn) = See / Show

> 这点小事他都记得，**足见**他很细心。
> *He remembers even this small matter; **it suffices to show** that he is very attentive.*

## 4. Common Mistakes

**1. Using it for future intent:**

* ❌ 下雨了，**可见**我不去了。
  * *It's raining, [inference] I won't go.*
* ✅ 下雨了，**所以**我不去了。
  * *It's raining, **so** I won't go.*

**2. Missing the "Evidence"**
**可见** cannot start a conversation. It must look back at a preceding statement or context.
