# HSK4-19 以及 (yǐjí)

## Core Concept: The "Extension" And

**以及** is a formal conjunction meaning "as well as" or "and."

While it translates similarly to the common **和 (hé)**, **以及** carries a specific structural weight. It implies that the speaker is listing main items and then *extending* the list to include one more thing. It often connects elements that are longer or more complex than simple nouns.

### Linguistic Formula
>
> [Item A], [Item B], **以及** [Item C]

## Comparison: 以及 vs. 和 (hé)

This is the most critical distinction for learners.

| Feature | 和 (hé) | 以及 (yǐjí) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Register** | Neutral / Spoken | Formal / Written |
| **Structure** | Balanced (A + B) | Extension (A … plus B) |
| **Scope** | Mostly Nouns | Nouns, Verbs, Clauses |
| **Punctuation** | No comma before it | Can take a comma: `A，以及B` |

### 1. The "Supplementary" Nuance

**和** suggests A and B are grouped tightly together. **以及** can suggest that what follows is an addition or a separate category.

* **和 (Tight Group):**
  > 我买了一些苹果**和**香蕉。
  > *I bought some apples and bananas.* (Simple list)

* **以及 (Extension):**
  > 这里的空气、水**以及**土壤都受到了污染。
  > *The air, water, **as well as** the soil here have all been polluted.*
  > (Formal listing; emphasizes the scope extending to all these elements)

### 2. Connecting Verbal Phrases

**和** struggles to connect long verbal phrases or clauses. **以及** thrives there.

> *Example: Discussing job responsibilities*
>
> * **Weak/Wrong with 和:** 他负责招聘新员工**和**培训他们。
> * **Better with 以及:** 他负责招聘新员工**以及**培训他们。
>   *(He is responsible for recruiting new staff **as well as** training them.)*

## Syntactic Pattern: The "A, B, as well as C" List

In formal writing, when listing three or more items, **以及** is preferred for the final item to avoid the casual feeling of **和**.

> 会议讨论了公司的现状、存在的问题**以及**未来的发展计划。
> *The meeting discussed the company's status, existing problems, **and** future development plans.*

## Common Error: Double Connecting

Learners sometimes redundantly use "and" words together.

* **❌ Wrong:** …**和以及**…
* **❌ Wrong:** …**并且以及**…
* **✓ Right:** Just use **以及**.

## Collocation: "以及其他..."

You will often see **以及** introducing "other" items.
> 老师、学生**以及其他**工作人员...
> *Teachers, students, **and other** staff members...*
