# HSK4-46 于是 (yúshì)

## Core Concept: The Narrative Bridge

**于是** acts as a bridge in a narrative timeline. It indicates that the second clause follows the first in time **and** is usually a result of it.

While often translated as "so" or "therefore," a more precise linguistic gloss is **"thereupon"**. It captures the feeling of: *"Event A happened. Immediately following that (and because of it), Event B happened."*

### Syntactic Position

**于是** is a **conjunction** (连词). It typically sits at the very beginning of the second clause.

* Clause 1，**于是** Clause 2。

## The "Sequential Consequence" Constraint

The key constraint of **于是** is that it requires a **narrative flow**. It cannot link two static states.

* **✅ Dynamic Event:**
  > 天下雨了，**于是**比赛取消了。  
  > *Tiān xiàyǔ le, yúshì bǐsài qǔxiāo le.*  
  > It started to rain, **so/thereupon** the match was canceled.  
  > (Event A → Sequential Consequence B)

* **❌ Static State:**
  > 他是中国人，**于是**他会说中文。 (Awkward/Incorrect)  
  > *Tā shì Zhōngguórén, yúshì tā huì shuō Zhōngwén.*  
  > He is Chinese, **so** he speaks Chinese.  
  > (Being Chinese is a static fact, not an "event" on a timeline. Use **所以** here.)

## Comparison: 于是 vs. 所以 (suǒyǐ)

Both translate to "so/therefore," but their focus differs:

| Feature | 所以 (suǒyǐ) | 于是 (yúshì) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | **Logical Causality** (Reason → Result) | **Temporal Sequence** (Event → Sequel) |
| **Static States** | OK (Because A is true, B is true) | **No** (Needs an event/action) |
| **Tone** | Logical, argumentative | Narrative, storytelling |

**Example Analysis:**
> 大家都同意，**于是**我们也同意了。  
> *Everyone agreed, **so** we agreed too.*  
> (Narrative focus: They did it, **following which**, we did it.)
> 大家都同意，**所以**我们也同意了。  
> *Everyone agreed, **therefore** we agreed too.*  
> (Logical focus: The reason for our agreement is their agreement.)

## Comparison: 于是 vs. 就 (jiù)

Students often confuse these because both imply sequence.

* **于是 (Conjunction):** Connects **Clause A** and **Clause B**. It stands *between* them (or at the start of B).
* **就 (Adverb):** Lives **inside** Clause B, after the subject (Topic) and before the verb.

> 1. 他回到家，**于是**睡觉了。 (He got home, **and then/so** went to sleep.)
> 2. 他回到家**就**睡觉了。 (He got home **and immediately** went to sleep.)

*Note: In sentence 2, the connection is tighter and faster. **于是** allows for a breath or a pause between the events.*

## Nuance: The "Taking Action" Vibe

**于是** is frequently used when the subject makes a conscious decision or takes action in response to a situation.

> 这里的风景太美了，**于是**他决定多住几天。  
> *Zhèlǐ de fēngjǐng tài měi le, yúshì tā juédìng duō zhù jǐ tiān.*  
> The scenery here was so beautiful, **so [upon realizing this]** he decided to stay a few more days.
