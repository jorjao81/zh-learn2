# 等于 (děngyú)

## Core Concept: Mathematical and Consequential Equivalence

While **等于 (děngyú)** is the standard mathematical term for "equals"
(as in $1 + 1 = 2$), its most potent use in discourse is to mark
**consequential equivalence**.

In this sense, it translates best to "is tantamount to," "amounts to," or
"is effectively the same as." It equates an action with its (often negative
or unintended) result.

## Syntactic Analysis

Structurally, **等于** is a verb composed of **等** (equal/rank) + **于**
(to/at).

$$ \text{NP}_1 / \text{VP}_1 + \text{等于} + \text{NP}_2 / \text{VP}_2 $$

Unlike simple copulas (like 是), **等于** implies a process of
**evaluation** or **calculation**. The speaker is asserting that Subject A,
while explicitly different in form from Subject B, yields the same value
or outcome.

### 1. Mathematical/Literal Equality

The baseline usage.

* 一加一**等于**二。
  * *Yī jiā yī **děngyú** èr.*
  * One plus one equals two.

### 2. Consequential Equivalence (The "Tantamount To" Construction)

This is the pragmatic sweet spot. You use this to reframe an action by its
ultimate implication.

* 如果不去投票，就**等于**放弃了你的权利。
  * *Rúguǒ bú qù tóupiào, jiù **děngyú** fàngqìle nǐ de quánlì.*
  * If [you] don't go vote, [it] **is tantamount to** abandoning your
    rights.
  * *(Note: The second clause is effectively nominalized; the act of not
    voting EQUALS the act of abandoning rights.)*

* 你这样做**等于**自杀。
  * *Nǐ zhèyàng zuò **děngyú** zìshā.*
  * Doing this **amounts to** suicide.

### 3. "Equivalent to" in Comparison

Used to compare values, weights, or exchange rates.

* 这就**等于**说，我们白忙了一天。
  * *Zhè jiù **děngyú** shuō, wǒmen bái mángle yì tiān.*
  * This **is equivalent to** saying that we worked all day for nothing.

## Nuance and Pragmatics

### The "Empty" Object (Zero Anaphora)

In conversation, you might hear **等于** used with "nothing" or an implied
object to mean "it was all for nothing" or "it's like I didn't do it."

* 这药我吃了没用，**等于**没吃。
  * *Zhè yào wǒ chīle méi yòng, **děngyú** méi chī.*
  * I took this medicine but it was useless; [it's] **just as if** [I]
    hadn't taken it.

### Comparison with 相当于 (xiāngdāngyú)

* **等于 (děngyú)**: Absolute equality or logical identity. Stronger
  assertion. "A **is** B."
* **相当于 (xiāngdāngyú)**: Comparative equivalence or analogy.
  "A is **comparable to** / **corresponds to** B."

| Context | Sentence | Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strict Value** | 100 cents **等于** 1 dollar. | Exact same value. |
| **Analogy** | The CEO **相当于** a captain. | Functional analogy. |
| **Result** | Ignoring him **等于** agreeing. | Outcome is identical. |

## Common Collocations

* **等于零** (děngyú líng): Equals zero; all for nothing; futile.
  * *所有的努力都等于零。* (All effort came to naught.)
* **不等于** (bù děngyú): Does not mean / does not imply.
  * *有钱**不等于**幸福。* (Having money **does not equate to** happiness.)
