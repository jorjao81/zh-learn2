# HSK5-08 总算 (zǒngsuàn)

## 1. Core Concept: The Subjective Reckoning

**总算 (zǒngsuàn)** is a **modal adverb (语气副词)** that can be best understood through its literal composition: "total/all" (总) + "reckoned/calculated" (算). It signals that, *all things considered* or *at the final reckoning*, a result has been achieved.

Unlike simple temporal adverbs that mark *when* something happens, **总算** marks the speaker's **attitude** toward the event's realization. It conveys a sense of **relief** or **acceptance** following a period of waiting, effort, or uncertainty.

It has two distinct but related pragmatic functions:

1. **Eventual Realization (Finally):** "Thank goodness it finally happened."
2. **Concessive Evaluation (On the whole / Passable):** "It's not perfect, but it counts as acceptable."

## 2. Function 1: Relief after Effort (Finally)

In this usage, **总算** indicates that an expected or desired event has finally taken place, implying that the process was long, difficult, or worrying.

**Structure:** `Subject + 总算 + Verb Phrase / Result`

* **Subjective Relief:** The key difference between **总算** and **终于 (zhōngyú)** is subjective affect. **总算** suggests the speaker has been mentally "counting down" or waiting for this outcome.
* **Positive Desirability:** Because it expresses relief, the result is almost always positive or desired by the speaker.

**Examples:**

* 雨**总算**停了，我们可以出门了。
    (Yǔ **zǒngsuàn** tíng le, wǒmen kěyǐ chūmén le.)
    *The rain has **finally** stopped [to my relief]; we can go out.*
* 试了一下午，我**总算**把这台机器修好了。
    (Shì le yī xiàwǔ, wǒ **zǒngsuàn** bǎ zhè tái jīqì xiūhǎo le.)
    *After trying all afternoon, I **finally** managed to fix this machine.*

## 3. Function 2: Evaluative Concession (Basically / By and large)

Here, **总算** shifts from "finally" to "all things considered." It is used to evaluate a situation as "good enough" or "acceptable," often implying it falls short of perfection but avoids a negative outcome. It is a linguistic shrug of acceptance.

**Structure:** `Subject + (还/也) + 总算 + Adjective / VP`

* **Comparison:** Implicitly compares the current state to a worse potential alternative.
* **Collocation:** Often appears with **还 (hái)** to soften the tone further ("still counts as...").

**Examples:**

* 虽然工资不高，但工作**总算**稳定。
    (Suīrán gōngzī bù gāo, dàn gōngzuò **zǒngsuàn** wěndìng.)
    *Although the salary isn't high, the job is **at least** stable [it implies: stable enough to be acceptable].*
* 这篇这类文章写得**总算**通顺，虽然没有什么新意。
    (Zhè piān zhèlèi wénzhāng xiě de **zǒngsuàn** tōngshùn, suīrán méiyǒu shénme xīnyì.)
    *This article is written clearly enough (**passable**), even if it lacks originality.*

## 4. Comparison: 总算 vs. 终于

This is the most critical distinction for learners. Both translate to "finally," but their underlying semantics differ.

| Feature | 终于 (zhōngyú) | 总算 (zǒngsuàn) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Meaning** | Objective finality (At last) | Subjective relief (Thank goodness) |
| **Focus** | The **result** emerging from a process | The **speaker's feeling** about the result |
| **Outcome Nature** | Can be good or bad | Usually good/desired (or acceptable) |
| **Grammar** | Adverb | Adverb (can rarely function as verb: "count as") |

**The "Bad Result" Test:**

* ✓ 他努力了很久，**终于**失败了。(He tried for a long time and **finally** failed.)
    *Syntactically valid. Sounds like an objective narration of a tragedy.*
* ? 他努力了很久，**总算**失败了。(He tried for a long time and **thank goodness he** failed.)
    *Pragmatically odd. Only works if you wanted him to fail (e.g., observing an enemy).*

## 5. Usage Constraints

1. **Past/Completed events:** Since it involves a "reckoning" of a process, it is most often used with completed actions (often with **了**).
    * *Wrong:* *明天我总算去。 (Tomorrow I finally go.)*
    * *Right:* 明天我**总算**可以休息了。 (Tomorrow I **finally** get to rest.) — *Note: Here it works because the state of "being able to rest" is the realized result.*
2. **Not for questions:** You generally don't ask someone if they "subjectively felt relief" in a yes/no question structure using this adverb.
