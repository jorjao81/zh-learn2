# NON-HSK: Rashly/Without Prudence (贸然)

| Category | Chinese | Pinyin | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adverb | 贸然 | màorán | rashly; hastily; without due consideration |

## 1. The Core Concept: The "Prudence Void"

**贸然 (màorán)** describes an action taken without the necessary
preparation, investigation, or social authorization. It is not just "fast"
(like 赶快); it is **blind** to the risks or consequences.

Think of it as the linguistic opposite of **审慎** (shěnshèn -
cautious/prudent).

If you do something **贸然**, you are violating a constraint—either a
safety constraint (checking if the ice is thick enough) or a social
constraint (checking if it's polite to visit).

## 2. Syntactic & Pragmatic Usage

**贸然** is an adverb appearing before the verb.

### A. The Negative Warning (Most Common)

It is extremely frequent in warnings or prohibitions, advising *against*
acting blindly.

* **Syntax:** 不要/不可/切勿 + 贸然 + [Action]
* **Example:**
  * 我们不了解情况，**切勿贸然行事**。
  * *Wǒmen bù liǎojiě qíngkuàng, **qièwù màorán xíngshì**.*
  * We don't understand the situation; **under no circumstances should we
    act blindly/rashly**.

### B. The Polite Refusal (Social Face)

In formal business or diplomatic contexts, **贸然** is used to deflect
requests by claiming one lacks the necessary information to commit. This
saves face: "I'm not saying *no*, I'm saying I can't be *imprudent*."

* **Example:**
  * 这件事关系重大，我不能**贸然**答应你。
  * *Zhè jiàn shì guānxì zhòngdà, wǒ bùnéng **màorán** dāying nǐ.*
  * This matter is of great consequence; I cannot **rashly** promise you
    (without further study).

### C. Describing Mistakes

When used in the past tense, it almost always introduces the *cause* of
a failure or an awkward situation.

* **Example:**
  * 他**贸然**去拜访教授，结果教授不在。
  * *Tā **màorán** qù bàifǎng jiàoshòu, jiéguǒ jiàoshòu búzài.*
  * He **presumptuously** went to visit the professor (without calling
    ahead), and as a result, the professor wasn't there.

## 3. Synonyms and Comparisons

* **Comparison:**

    if it was live) or **鲁莽** (recklessly stupid).

## 5. Origin Note

The character **贸** is standardly known for "trade" (贸易). How did it
get to "rashly"?

* Classical interpretations suggest a link to "dim vision" or "muddled,"
  implies acting with eyes closed or exchange without verifying quality.
* It implies a "blind exchange" of one's safety/reputation for an action.
