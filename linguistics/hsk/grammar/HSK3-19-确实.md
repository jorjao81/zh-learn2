# HSK3-19 确实 (Indeed / Truly)

## 1. The Core Concept: "Validation"

**确实** (quèshí) is an adverb of **confirmation**. It affirms that a statement, an observation, or a reputation is objectively true.

While **其实** (qíshí) says "You thought X, but it's Y," **确实** says "You thought X, and yes, it really is X."

* It validates objective facts.
* It agrees with previous speakers.
* It emphasizes sincerity.

## 2. Syntax & Usage

    (Zhèlǐ de fēngjǐng **quèshí** hěn piàoliang.)

  *(Context: Everyone says it's beautiful, or I am seeing it now and confirming it.)*

### B. Agreeing with Someone (In Dialogue)
* A: 这个句子很难懂。 (This sentence is hard to understand.)

### C. Adjectival Use (Reliable/True)
