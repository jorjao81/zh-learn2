# HSK 4 Grammar: 对于 (duìyú) — Regarding / Concerning

In Chinese linguistics, **对于 (duìyú)** is categorized as a **preposition (介词 - jiècí)**. It is primarily used to introduce the object, person, or situation toward which an action is directed or an attitude is held.

## 1. Core Function

**对于** introduces the "target" (对象 - duìxiàng) or the "scope" (范围 - fànwéi) of a viewpoint, treatment, or state of affairs. It effectively sets the stage by highlighting what the following statement is "about."

## 2. Sentence Structures

### A. At the beginning of a sentence (Topic-Fronting)

When placed at the start, it serves to define the topic clearly before the main clause.
> **对于 + Object, Subject + Verb/Attitude.**
>
> * **对于**这个问题，我有不同的看法。
> * *(Regarding this problem, I have a different view.)*

### B. After the subject

It can also be placed between the subject and the predicate to specify the target of the subject's action or feeling.
> **Subject + 对于 + Object + Verb/Attitude.**
>
> * 老师**对于**每个学生都很关心。
> * *(The teacher is very concerned regarding every student.)*

## 3. Linguistic Distinctions: 对于 vs. 对

While **对于** and **对 (duì)** are often interchangeable when meaning "regarding," there are critical linguistic boundaries to observe:

1. **Formality:** **对于** is more formal and is more frequently found in written Chinese or formal speeches. **对** is more versatile and common in daily conversation.
2. **Breadth of Meaning:** **对** has a much wider range of uses. It can indicate direction (toward), a direct action between people, or "to/for." **对于** is strictly limited to "regarding/concerning."
3. **Incompatibility in Direct Action:** If the sentence describes a direct action from one person to another (like "speaking to someone"), you **must** use **对**, not **对于**.
    * *Correct:* 我**对**他说过这件事。 (I spoke to him about this.)
    * *Incorrect:* 我~~对于~~他说过这件事。

## 4. Examples in Context

* **对于**这件往事，他已经忘得差不多了。
  * *(Regarding this past event, he has almost forgotten it all.)*
* 我们**对于**环境污染问题必须引起重视。
  * *(We must pay serious attention regarding the issue of environmental pollution.)*
* **对于**新来的同事，我们要热烈欢迎。
  * *(Regarding the newly arrived colleagues, we should give a warm welcome.)*

## Summary for the Learner

Think of **对于** as a tool to "point" at the topic you are about to discuss. It signals to the listener that the information following it is specifically applicable to the object you just introduced. Use it when you want to sound precise, formal, and linguistically organized.
