# Grammar Point: 千万 (qiānwàn)

| Category | Level | Character | Pinyin | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mood Adverb / Numeral | HSK 3 (三19) | 千万 | qiānwàn | ten million; must; be sure to; by all means |

## The Core Concept: "Ten Million" Reasons

Literally, **千万** means "Ten Million" (Thousand x Ten Thousand).
* **千** (qiān) = Thousand.
* **万** (wàn) = Ten Thousand.

Figuratively, it means "Countless amounts."
When used as an adverb, it implies: **"Even if there are ten million reasons to do otherwise, you MUST..."**

It is the strongest way to give advice or a warning.

## 1. Strong Warning / Advice (Imperative)

This is the grammar usage. It almost always appears before **要** (must), **别** (don't), or **不能** (cannot).

**Structure:** `千万 + 要 / 别 / 不能 + Verb`

* **过马路千万要小心。**
  * *Guò mǎlù qiānwàn yào xiǎoxīn.*
  * (When) crossing the road, **by all means** be careful.
* **你千万别告诉他。**
  * *Nǐ qiānwàn bié gàosu tā.*
  * You **absolutely must not** tell him.
* **这件事千万不能忘记。**
  * *Zhè jiàn shì qiānwàn bùnéng wàngjì.*
  * You **must not** forget this matter **under any circumstances**.

## 2. Usage Nuance

**千万** expresses the speaker's sincere concern and urgent request. It is stronger than simple advice but softer than a military order—it feels like a plea from a friend.

* **别去。** (Don't go.) -> Simple command.
* **千万别去。** (Whatever you do, don't go!) -> Urgent warning.

## Comparison: 千万 (qiānwàn) vs. 一定 (yídìng)

| Word | Nuance | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **一定** | Certainty / Determination | "I definitely will." / "You must." (Objective or subjective) |
| **千万** | Urgency / Pleading | "Be sure to..." / "By all means..." (Used almost exclusively in *requests/commands*). |

* *Usage:*
  * 我**一定**来。 (I will definitely come.) -> Correct.
  * 我**千万**来。 (I ten-million come?) -> **Incorrect.** You don't use 千万 to describe your own future action unless you are talking to yourself. It is for *exhorting others*.
