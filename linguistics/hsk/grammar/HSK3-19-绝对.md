# HSK3-19 绝对 (Absolutely)

## 1. The Core Concept: "Cut off from Comparison"

To understand **绝对** (juéduì), it helps to look at its logical opposite: **相对** (xiāngduì - relative).

* **相对** (Relative): *Xiāng* means "mutual" or "each other." Things that are "relative" exist in relation to each other.
* **绝对** (Absolute): *Jué* means "to cut off" or "sever." **绝对** describes something that is "cut off" from any comparison or condition. It stands alone, unconditional and undeniable.

When you use **绝对**, you are strictly shutting down any possibility of "maybe," "if," or "sort of." It is a high-modality marker of certainty.

## 2. Syntax & Usage

### A. As a Strong Adverb (The most common use)

Used before verbs or adjectives to indicate 100% certainty or intensity.

*Structure:* `Subject + 绝对 + Verb/Adj`

* 这水是经过消毒的，**绝对**干净。
    (Zhè shuǐ shì jīngguò xiāodú de, **juéduì** gānjìng.)
  *This water has been sterilized; it is **absolutely** clean.*
* 我**绝对**没想到会在这里遇见你。
    (Wǒ **juéduì** méi xiǎngdào huì zài zhèlǐ yùjiàn nǐ.)
  *I **absolutely** did not expect to meet you here.*

### B. The Prohibition Pattern: 绝对不 / 绝对别

This is stronger than just saying "don't." It implies a strict rule or a guarantee.

* 这种错误**绝对**不能再犯。
    (Zhè zhǒng cuòwù **juéduì** bùnéng zài fàn.)
  *This kind of mistake must **absolutely** not be committed again.*
* 我**绝对**不会告诉任何人。
    (Wǒ **juéduì** bú huì gàosu rènhé rén.)
  *I will **absolutely** not tell anyone.* (A solemn promise)

### C. As an Adjective

It can modify a noun to mean "absolute" (unconditional).

* 世界上没有**绝对**的公平。
    (Shìjiè shang méiyǒu **juéduì** de gōngpíng.)
  *In the world, there is no **absolute** fairness.*

## 3. Comparison: 绝对 vs. 肯定 vs. 一定

These all map to "certainly/definitely" in English, but the nuance differs:

| Word | Pinyin | Nuance |
|------|--------|--------|
| **一定** | yídìng | **Fixed/Definite.** Standard determination. "I will definitely go." |
| **肯定** | kěndìng | **Affirmative/Sure.** Objective confirmation or subjective guess based on evidence. "He is surely at home." |
| **绝对** | juéduì | **Absolute.** Removes all doubt or conditions. Strongest intensity. "It is absolutely impossible." |

**Example:**

* 他**一定**会来。 (He will definitely come. -> Prediction/Will)
* 他**肯定**来了。 (He surely has come. -> Deduction/Fact)
* 他**绝对**不敢来。 (He absolutely dares not come. -> Strong Assertion)

## 4. Common Pitfalls

**1. Don't use it for mild opinions.**

* *Weird:* 我绝对觉得这部电影好看。(I absolutely think this movie is good.)
* *Natural:* 我觉得这部电影**绝对**好看。(I think this movie is **absolutely** good.) -> Use it to modify the quality (*good*), not your act of thinking.

**2. Tone awareness.**
**绝对** can sound dogmatic or argumentative. If you say "你是绝对错的" (You are absolutely wrong), it is very harsh. Use **完全** (wánquán - completely) or **肯定** (kěndìng) for a slightly softer (but still firm) tone.
