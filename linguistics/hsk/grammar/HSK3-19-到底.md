| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mood Adverb | HSK 3 (三19) | 到底 | dàodǐ | on earth; after all; finally; to the end |

## The Core Concept: "To the Bottom"

**到** (arrive) + **底** (bottom).
Literally: "Arriving at the very bottom."

This core image explains its three main usages:

1. **Questioning:** Digging to the bottom of a mystery ("What *on earth*...?").
2. **Concluding:** Reaching the fundamental truth ("After all...").
3. **Action:** Doing something thoroughly ("To the end").

## 1. In Questions: "On Earth" / "The Hell"

Used to press for an answer or express impatience. It demands the "bottom line" truth.

**Structure:** `Subject + 到底 + Question Phrase`

* **你到底去不去？**
  * *Nǐ dàodǐ qù bú qù?*
  * Are you going or not, **after all**? (Make up your mind!)
* **他到底想说什么？**
  * *Tā dàodǐ xiǎng shuō shénme?*
  * What **on earth** does he want to say?
* **这到底是怎么回事？**
  * *Zhè dàodǐ shì zěnme huí shì?*
  * What **the heck** is going on here?

## 2. In Statements: "After all" / "Finally"

Used to emphasize a result reached after a long process, or a fundamental fact that cannot be ignored.

### A. Finally (Result)

* **经过三次尝试，他到底成功了。**
  * *Jīngguò sāncì chángshì, tā dàodǐ chénggōng le.*
  * After three attempts, he **finally** succeeded.
  * *(Similar to 终于 - zhōngyú)*

### B. After All (Fundamental Fact)

* **他到底是孩子，别对他太严格。**
  * *Tā dàodǐ shì háizi, bié duì tā tài yángé.*
  * He is a child **after all**, don't be too strict with him.
  * *(Also: 毕竟 - bìjìng)*

## 3. Verb Phrase: "To the End"

Here it is not an adverb, but a verb + complement structure.

* **坚持到底**
  * *Jiānchí dàodǐ*
  * Persist **to the end**.
* **进行到底**
  * *Jìnxíng dàodǐ*
  * Carry on **to the end**.

## Comparison: 到底 (dàodǐ) vs. 终于 (zhōngyú)

| Word | Usage |

| **终于** | Focuses on the **result** after a long time. Usually positive outcome. "Finally!" |
| **到底** | Can mean "finally" (result), but also "on earth" (question) and "after all" (nature). |

* *Question:* 你**到底**去哪儿？ (Where on earth are you going?) -> **终于** cannot be used here.
* *Result:* 飞机**终于**起飞了。 (The plane finally took off.) -> **到底** can be used, but **终于** is more common for simple elapsed time.
