# HSK4-20 既然 (Since; Given that)

**Pinyin:** jìrán (conjunction)

The core function of **既然 (jìrán)** is to introduce a **factual premise** that is already known or accepted by the listener, serving as the basis for a subsequent suggestion, inference, or decision. It belongs to the category of **causal conjunctions** connecting clauses, but unlike simple "because" markers, it emphasizes the *givenness* of the situation—"Given that X is the case, [then] Y."

## 1. The Logical Structure: "Given X, then Y"

The standard structure connects two clauses:

> **既然 + [Accepted Fact/Premise], (那/就/那……就……) + [Suggestion/Conclusion]**

* **Clause 1 (Premise):** Specifies a situation that has already happened or is acknowledged as true.
* **Clause 2 (Conclusion):** Offers a logical response to that reality.

Unlike **因为 (yīnwèi)**, which explains *why* something happened (focus on cause), **既然 (jìrán)** focuses on *what to do now* that the situation exists (focus on response/inference).

### Examples

* **既然**你都知道了，我就不多说了。
  * *Jìrán nǐ dōu zhīdào le, wǒ jiù bù duō shuō le.*
  * **Since** you already know everything, I won't say any more.
  * *(Premise: You know. Conclusion: No need for me to talk.)*

* **既然**他不肯来，**那**我们就不勉强他了。
  * *Jìrán tā bù kěn lái, nà wǒmen jiù bù miǎnqiǎng tā le.*
  * **Given that** he's unwilling to come, **then** let's not force him.

* **既然**是你的选择，你**就**要负责到底。
  * *Jìrán shì nǐ de xuǎnzé, nǐ jiù yào fùzé dàodǐ.*
  * **Since** it is your choice, you **must** be responsible to the end.

## 2. Linguistic Nuance: Factuality vs. Causality

It is helpful to contrast **既然 (jìrán)** with **因为 (yīnwèi)**:

* **因为 (yīnwèi)**: Answers "Why?" The cause might be new information to the listener.
  * *Context: "Why aren't you going?"*
  * 因为下雨了。 (Because it's raining.) — *Explaining the reason.*
* **既然 (jìrán)**: Answers "What now?" The cause is treated as shared ground.
  * *Context: "Look, it's raining!"*
  * 既然下雨了，我们就别去了。 (Since/Given that it's raining, let's not go.) — *Deriving a plan from the fact.*

You generally **cannot** answer a "Why?" question with 既然.
* Q: 你为什么辞职？ (Why did you resign?)
* A: ❌ **既然**工资太低…… (Incorrect usage)
* A: ✅ **因为**工资太低…… (Correct)

## 3. Collocations and Registers

**既然** is often paired with specific markers in the second clause to signal the result/inference:

* **就 (jiù)**: "then..." (most common)
* **也 (yě)**: "even so..." / "also..."
* **还 (hái)**: "still..." (often in rhetorical questions)
* **那 (nà) / 那么 (nàme)**: "in that case..."

### Rhetorical Force
It is frequently used in rhetorical questions (反问句) to challenge illogical behavior:

* **既然**你不喜欢，为什么还要买？
  * *Jìrán nǐ bù xǐhuan, wèishénme hái yào mǎi?*
  * **Since** you don't like it, why are you still buying it?

## 4. "Just the facts"

The clause following **既然** must be a declarative statement of fact or a conceded point. It cannot be a question or a conjecture about the future (unless that conjecture is treated as a settled assumption).

* ✅ **既然**明天要考试…… (Since [it is a fact that] there is an exam tomorrow...)
* ❌ **既然**明天会不会下雨…… (Incorrect: cannot be a question)

## 5. Common Errors

**Mistake:** Using 既然 for simple causality where inference isn't the point.
* *Bad:* 既然我饿了，我吃了一个苹果。 (Sounds odd: "Given that I was hungry, I ate an apple.")
* *Better:* 因为我饿了，所以我吃了一个苹果。 ("Because I was hungry, I ate an apple.")
* *Correct 既然 context:* 既然你饿了，这里有个苹果，你拿去吃吧。 ("Since you are hungry [accepted fact], here is an apple, go ahead and eat it.")

**Summary:** **因为** looks backward at the cause; **既然** looks forward to the consequence.
