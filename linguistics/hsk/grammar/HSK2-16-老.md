# HSK2 Grammar Point: 老 (lǎo) - Adverbial "Always"

## Core Concept: The Colloquial Constant

In HSK2, **老 (lǎo)** appears not as the adjective "old," but as a high-frequency colloquial adverb meaning "always," "constantly," or "forever."

Like its bisyllabic cousin **老是 (lǎoshì)**, it is primarily used to express **subjective frequency** with a tone of **dissatisfaction** or **exaggeration**. It signals that an action happens more often than the speaker would like.

## Syntactic Structure

$$ \text{Subject} + \text{老} + \text{Verb Phrase} $$

* **老** modifies the predicate directly.
* It is restricted to **informal spoken Chinese**. You will rarely see this in formal writing.

## Pragmatics & Nuance

### 1. The Complaint Factor
Using **老** implies the speaker is annoyed. It translates to "keeps [verb]-ing" or "is always [verb]-ing" in a nagging tone.

* 你怎么**老**迟到？
    *Nǐ zěnme **lǎo** chídào?*
    Why are you **always** late?

* 不管是吃药还是打针，病**老**不好。
    *Bùguǎn shì chīyào háishì dǎzhēn, bìng **lǎo** bù hǎo.*
    Whether taking meds or getting shots, the illness **just won't** get better. (lit. "always not good")

### 2. Prosody and Rhythm
Because **老** is monosyllabic, it fits tightly into short, punchy sentences.
* **老哭** (lǎo kū) - keeps crying
* **老忘** (lǎo wàng) - keeps forgetting
* **老觉得** (lǎo juéde) - constantly feeling...

If the rhythm requires a second syllable for balance, speakers might switch to **老是** without changing the meaning.

## Ambiguity: Old vs. Always

The character **老** usually means "old" (adjective). The position determines the part of speech.

* **Adjective Position:** Before a noun.
  * **老**朋友 (lǎo péngyou) — *old* friend.
* **Adverb Position:** Before a verb/adjective predicate.
  * **老**生病 (lǎo shēngbìng) — *always* getting sick.

**Constraint:** You cannot use adverbial **老** before a noun.
* *他老钱。* (Incorrect. Cannot mean "He always has money" or anything similar.)
