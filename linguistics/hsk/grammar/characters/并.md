# Character: 并 (bìng)

## Core Meaning: Combine, Side-by-Side

The character **并** (Traditional: 並/併) depicts two people standing side by side or two objects placed together.

### Etymology & Visuals
* **Original Form (並):** Showed two human figures (人) standing on the ground (一), symbolizing "together" or "side by side."
* **Variant (併):** Added the person radical (亻) to emphasize the human action of merging or combining.
* **Simplified (并):** Derived from the cursive form, merging the top components into two dots/horns.

### Semantic Extensions

1. **Side by Side / Equal:**
    * **并列** (bìngliè) = Side-by-side + Line up = Juxtapose / Coordinate / Tie (for first place).
    * **并排** (bìngpái) = Side-by-side + Row = Side by side.
2. **Combine / Merge:**
    * **合并** (hébìng) = Join + Combine = Merge (companies, folders).
    * **吞并** (tūnbìng) = Swallow + Combine = Annex (territory).
3. **Simultaneously:** Doing two things at once (from "side by side").
    * **并且** (bìngqiě) = Moreover / Furthermore.
    * **并重** (bìngzhòng) = Equally important (pay equal attention to).
4. **Intensifier (Negative):** (The grammar point).
    * **并不** (bìngbù) = "Combined with 'not'" -> Actually not / Not at all.
    * (The logic is likely: "Taken all together -> Not X" or an evolution of "Even" -> "Even not" -> "Actually not").

### Usage Note
In Traditional Chinese, **並** is often used for "side-by-side/and" and **併** for "merge/combine," though they overlap. Simplified Chinese merged them both into **并**.
