# Character Breakdown: 假如 (jiǎrú)

The word **假如** combines the concept of "falsehood/borrowing" with
"similarity" to create the meaning "supposing."

## 1. 假 (jiǎ / jià)

* **Meaning 1 (jiǎ)**: False, fake, artificial.
  * **假**发 (jiǎfà) - Wig ("fake hair")
  * 虚**假** (xūjiǎ) - False/Phony
* **Meaning 2 (jiǎ)**: To borrow, to avail oneself of, to suppose.
  * **假**手 (jiǎshǒu) - To do something through someone else
    ("borrow hand")
  * **假**设 (jiǎshè) - Hypothesis ("suppose-set")
* **Meaning 3 (jià)**: Vacation, holiday (time "borrowed" from work).
  * 请**假** (qǐngjià) - To ask for leave

In **假如**, it takes the meaning of **"suppose"** (treating a fake
scenario as if it were real).

## 2. 如 (rú)

* **Meaning**: Like, as, as if; to equal.
* **Role**: Comparison marker.
* **Common Words**:
  * **如**果 (rúguǒ) - If ("if [it is] the fruit/result")
  * 比**如** (bǐrú) - For example ("compare-like")
  * **如**意 (rúyì) - Satisfactory ("like [one's] wish")

## Synthesis

**假如** = "Suppose" + "Like"

Literally: "**Supposing [it is] like...**"

This construction is very similar to **如果** (If/In case).

* **如果**: "Like the fruit/result [is]..."
* **假如**: "Supposing [it is] like..."

**假如** highlights the **imaginary** nature of the condition slightly more
than **如果** does, which is why it's preferred for hypothetical questions
("If you were a bird...") or formal suppositions.
