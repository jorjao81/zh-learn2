# Word Analysis: 倒是 (dàoshì)

## Component Breakdown

### 1. 倒 (dào) - The Pivot

* **Pronunciation**: dào (4th tone)
* **Meaning**: To invert, to move backwards, contrary to expectation.
* **Etymology**: Radical 亻(Person) + Phonetic 到 (Arrive).
* **Tone Distinction**:
  * *dǎo* (3rd): To fall over (physical collapse).
  * *dào* (4th): To invert/reverse (logic/direction).
  * **In 倒是**: Uses 4th tone because it "inverts" the flow of
    conversation or expectation.

### 2. 是 (shì) - The Affirmer

* **Meaning**: To be, correct, yes.
* **Function**: Acts as a stabilizer for the adverb.

## Semantic Composition

**倒 (Reverse) + 是 (Be)** = "Reversing [the expectation] is [the case]."

While `是` usually equates A and B, adding `倒` acts as a signal that the
affirmation comes from an unexpected angle.

* "It isn't what you thought, but **contrarily** (倒) it **is** (是)..."

## Cognitive Mnemonics

Think of `倒是` as a **Pivot Point**:

* You walk in one direction (Expectation).
* You hit `倒是`.
* You turn 180 degrees (Contrast/Concession).
