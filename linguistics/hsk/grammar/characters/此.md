# Character Breakdown: 此 (cǐ)

## Core Meaning

**This / Here / Now** (Proximal Demonstrative)

## Etymology & Evolution

* **Script Form**: The character combines **止** (foot/to stop) and **匕** (a person standing).
* **Original Imagery**: A person stopping their feet.
* **Semantic Shift**: "Where the feet stop" → "Here" → "This".
* **Linguistic Context**: It is the Classical/Literary equivalent of the vernacular **这** (zhè).

## Key Compounds

Understanding **此** unlocks many formal words:

1. **Time**:
    * **此时** (cǐshí): This time / right now.
    * **此刻** (cǐkè): This moment.
    * **从此** (cóngcǐ): From this time forward / henceforth.

2. **Place**:
    * **此地** (cǐdì): This place (often seen in idioms like 此地无银三百两).
    * **在此** (zàicǐ): (Located) here.

3. **Logic/Abstract**:

    * **因此** (yīncǐ): Because of *this* (Therefore).
    * **彼此** (bǐcǐ): That and this → One another / Each other. (One of the most useful words to know. *Bǐ* = that, *Cǐ* = this).

## Usage Note

In modern spoken Chinese, you rarely say "我要买**此**书" (I want to buy *cǐ* book). You say "**这**本书". **此** is reserved for:

1. Fixed compounds (as above).
2. Formal writing (contracts, news, signs).
3. Idioms (e.g., **乐不思蜀** implies forgetting where one came from, but **顾此失彼** - attend to *this* and lose *that*).
