# Character Breakdown: 既然 (jìrán)

## 既 (jì)

**Core Meaning:** Already; To finish; Since.

* **Etymology:** The ancient form of **既** depicts a person kneeling beside a food vessel (guǐ) with their head turned away/backwards. This vivid imagery suggests someone who has **finished eating** and is turning away from the table.
* **Semantic Evolution:**
  1. Finished eating (original meaning).
  2. Finished / Completed action (generalized).
  3. Already (temporal aspect: the event is done).
  4. Since / Given that (logical aspect: the premise is "already" established).

* **Key Compounds:**
  * **既**定 (jìdìng): Already decided / Established (e.g., 既定方针 - established policy).
  * **既**往不咎 (jìwǎngbùjiù): Let bygones be bygones (literally: [regarding] what is **already** past, do not blame).
  * **既**……又…… (jì...yòu...): Both... and... (Literally: [It is] already X, [and] also Y).

## 然 (rán)

**Core Meaning:** Correct; So; Like this; (Suffix for adverbs/adjectives).

* **Etymology:** Originally a pictograph for "to burn" (cooking dog meat over fire), which is now written as **燃** (rán). The character was borrowed to serve as a grammatical function word meaning "yes", "correct", or "so".
* **Function in 既然:** Here, **然** functions as a demonstrative pro-form meaning "so" or "like this" (similar to 这样 or 如此).
* **Logic:**
  * **既** (Already) + **然** (So/Like this)
  * "It is **already like this**..." → "Since this is the case..."

* **Key Compounds:**
  * 自**然** (zìrán): Nature / Natural (Self-so; being so of itself).
  * 当**然** (dāngrán): Of course (Should be so).
  * 虽**然** (suīrán): Although (Even if [it is] so).
  * 不**然** (bùrán): Otherwise (If not so).

## Synthesis: 既然

When you say **既然 (jìrán)**, you are literally saying: **"[The situation] being already so..."** or **"[Since it is] already like this..."**

This etymology explains why **既然** is used to introduce an **accepted fact**. You aren't introducing new information; you are pointing to a situation that is "already so" (finished/established) and using it as a stepping stone for your next point.
