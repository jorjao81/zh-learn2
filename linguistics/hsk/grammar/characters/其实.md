# Character Breakdown: 其实 (qíshí)

**其** (qí): his / her / its / that / such

- **Etymology**: Originally a pictograph of a winnowing basket (made of
  bamboo). It was borrowed to act as a pronoun (demonstrative or possessive)
  in Classical Chinese because the pronunciation was similar.
- **Function**: In modern compounds, it often refers to "that" or "it."

**实** (shí): real / true / honest / solid / fruit / seed

- **Etymology**: Represents a house (宀) full of wealth/cowries (贯/贝).
  "Fullness" led to meanings of "solid," "fruit" (filling of a flower),
  and "reality."
- **Combination**: **其实** literally means "its reality" or "the reality
  of it."
  - "He looks happy. **其实** (The reality of it [is])..."
