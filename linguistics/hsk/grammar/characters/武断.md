# Character Breakdown: 武断 (wǔduàn)

## 1. 武 (wǔ)

**Meaning**: Martial, military, force, fierce.

* **Etymology**: A compound ideogram (`会意`). It combines `止` (foot/to stop) and `戈` (dagger-axe/weapon).
  * *Traditional Interpretation*: "Stopping the weapon" → true martial art is to stop war.
  * *Modern Paleographic Interpretation*: "Marching (`止`) with a weapon (`戈`)" → military force.
* **Role in Compound**: Here it signifies "force" or "dominance" as opposed to reason or civil administration (`文`). It suggests a style of action that is forceful and perhaps crude.

## 2. 断 (duàn)

**Meaning**: To break, to cut, to judge/decide.

* **Radical**: `斤` (axe).
* **Role in Compound**: As seen in `果断` (decisive) and `判断` (judgment), `断` refers to the act of making a final decision or conclusion.

## Synthesis: 武断 (wǔduàn)

**Literal**: "Martial decision" or "Forceful judgment."

**Historical Evolution**:
Originally, this term referred to local tyrants or strongmen (`武断乡曲`) who used their power to dominate local affairs arbitrarily.
* **Evolution**: Tyrannical power → Abuse of power → Arbitrary decision-making → Subjective judgment (without evidence).

Today, the "military/tyrant" literal sense is gone, leaving only the abstract sense of a judgment made by *imposing one's will* rather than *following the evidence*.
