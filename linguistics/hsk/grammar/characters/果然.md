# 果然 (guǒrán): Indeed / As Expected / Sure Enough

## Character Breakdown

**果** (guǒ): fruit / result / determined

- **Etymology**: A tree with round fruits on top.
- **Meaning**: "Fruit" implies the end product or the result. Hence **结果**
  (result), **后果** (consequence).

**然** (rán): correct / so / like this

- **Function**: A suffix making adjectives or adverbs (similar to "-ly" or "in
  a ... manner"). Also means "so/like this" (as in **这样**).
- **Combination**: **果然** literally means "Fruit-ly" or "Result-so." The
  result is just as the "fruit" of the situation promised.
