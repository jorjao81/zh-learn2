# Character Breakdown: 毅然 (yìrán)

## 毅 (yì)

* **Pinyin:** yì
* **Meaning:** Firm, resolute, stalwart, will power
* **Structure:**
  * Left: **𧈇** (Older form of 豕 "shǐ" pig/boar + 辛 "xīn" bitter/suffering/crime). In the modern simplified/traditional character `毅`, the left side is **豙** (yì), which is a phonetic component but also depicts an angry boar with bristling hair.
  * Right: **殳** (shū) = Weapon / To kill / A spear-like tool.
* **Etymology:** The original meaning depicted a **wild boar** being attacked or in a state of fury. Wild boars are known for their relentless aggression and inability to be easily stopped once they charge. This evolved into the abstract meaning of **determination, unbending will, and firmness**.
* **Key Compounds:**
  * **毅力 (yìlì)**: Willpower / Stamina / Grit (The strength of the "boar")
  * **刚毅 (gāngyì)**: Fortitude / Resolute (Hard + Resolute)

## 然 (rán)

* **Pinyin:** rán
* **Meaning:** Correct; So; Like this; (Adverb suffix)
* **Structure:**
  * Top Left: **月** (meat/flesh - originally **ròu**)
  * Top Right: **犬** (dog - **quǎn**)
  * Bottom: **灬** (fire - **huǒ**)
* **Etymology:** The original character depicted **roasting dog meat** over a fire (yes, really).
  * It originally meant "to burn" (which is now written as **燃** - they added the fire radical *again* to the left to disambiguate the verb "burn" from the abstract grammatical particle).
  * The meaning was borrowed early on to mean "yes" or "so" (affirmation).
  * It became a grammatical suffix in Classical Chinese equivalent to "...like" or "...manner."
* **Function in 毅然:**
  * Here, it functions purely as the suffix turning the quality **毅** (resolute) into the manner **毅-like** (resolutely).
