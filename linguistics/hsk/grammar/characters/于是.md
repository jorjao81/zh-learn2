# Character Breakdown: 于是 (yúshì)

## Etymological Logic

In Modern Chinese, **于是** is a single conjunction meaning "thereupon"
or "so". However, its internal logic reveals a frozen Classical Chinese
phrase.

### 1. 于 (yú) - The Preposition

* **Original Meaning:** To go; to equivalent to modern 往 (wǎng).
* **Classical/Formal Function:** A multipurpose preposition similar to
  English "at", "in", "on", "to", or "from". It is still used in formal
  contexts today (e.g., 生于 1990 "born **in** 1990", 等于 "equal **to**").

### 2. 是 (shì) - The Demonstrative

* **Modern Meaning:** The copula verb "to be" (am, is, are).
* **Classical Meaning:** A **demonstrative pronoun** meaning "**this**"
  (equivalent to modern 这).
  * *Trace of this usage:* In the idiom **是**日 (shìrì), meaning "**this**
    day". Or in the phrase **是**可忍，孰不可忍 ("If **this** can be
    tolerated, what cannot?").

## The Combination

When combined in Classical Chinese:
> **于** (In/From) + **是** (This)
> = **"In this [situation]..."** or **"From this [point]..."**

Over time, this phrase lexicalized into a single conjunction indicating
that the next action flows directly "from this" situation.

### Cognate Logic: "Thereupon"

English has a similar construction. "Thereupon" literally means "Upon
that (time/event)".

* **There-** = That/This
* **-upon** = On/In (Preposition)

**于是** is structurally almost identical to "Thereupon" (or strictly
speaking "Hereupon" or "Herein").
