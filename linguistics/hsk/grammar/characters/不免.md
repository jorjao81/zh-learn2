## 免 (miǎn)

* **Core Meaning:** To excuse, to exempt, to remove, to avoid.
* **Etymology:** The character **免** depicts a person wearing a helmet or
  hat, but in the context of "escaping" or "avoiding" (as in escaping
  danger). Historically related to childbirth (delivery) in some contexts,
  but in modern usage, it primarily relates to exemption or avoidance.
* **Common Compounds:**
  * **免费** (miǎnfèi): Free of charge (exempt from fee).

  * **避免** (bìmiǎn): To avoid (to step aside and avoid).

## Synthesis: "Not Exempt"

**不免** literally means "not exempt" or "not avoided."

If you are **not exempt** from a feeling or outcome, you are subject to it.
It implies that the outcome essentially "captures" the subject because there
is no exemption card available for the specific situation.

Unlike **不得不** (cannot but / have to), which implies an external force
*pushing* you to act, **不免** implies that the situation itself *leads* to
the result, and you didn't "dodge" it.
