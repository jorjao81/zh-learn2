**绝** (jué): cut off / sever / unique / extreme

- **Etymology**: The radical is **纟** (silk/thread). The right side **色** (original form involving a person and a knife/knot) suggested cutting a thread.
- **Evolution**: From "cutting a thread" (severing connection), it extended to mean:
  1. **Cut off/End**: 绝望 (cut off from hope = despair), 灭绝 (extinct).
  2. **Unique/Unmatched**: Since it is cut off from peers, it is one of a kind. 绝技 (unique skill).
  3. **Extreme/Absolute**: Going to the limit. 绝妙 (extremely wonderful).

**对** (duì): face / correct / pair / opposite

- **Etymology**: Originally answering or responding. It implies a duality—two things facing each other.
- **Role in Compound**: In **绝对**, **绝** modifies **对**. It means the "facing" (relationship/relativity) is "cut off."
  - **相对** (xiāngduì): Mutual facing → **Relative** (Defined by relationship)
  - **绝对** (juéduì): Severed facing → **Absolute** (Defined by itself, no relationship)
