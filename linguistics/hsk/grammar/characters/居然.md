# Word Analysis: 居然 (jūrán)

## Component Breakdown

### 1. 居 (jū) - To Sit / Reside
* **Meaning**: To occupy a space, to sit, to reside.
* **Etymology**: 尸 (Body/Seated person) + 古 (Old/Heritage).
* **Connotation**: Stability, immobility, established position.

### 2. 然 (rán) - State Marker
* **Meaning**: Thus, so, like this.
* **Original Etymology**: Roasting dog meat (meat + dog + fire). Grammaticalized to mean "correct" or "state of being."

## Semantic Composition: 居 (Settled) + 然 (State)

Historically, this meant "calmly," "settled," or "obviously."
* "Sitting there like that" -> "Evidently so."

**The Semantic Flip (Mirativity)**:
Over time, the meaning shifted from "It is obviously/settled so" to "It turned out to be so (surprisingly)."
* Logic: "It was sitting there (fact) all along, and we just realized it?" OR "It is an established fact (despite our doubts)."

It implies a fact that is undeniable yet surprising, as if the fact "sat there" defiantly against expectation.

## Related Words
* **竟然 (jìngrán)**: *Jìng* means "to finish" or "unexpectedly." *Jūrán* and *Jìngrán* are almost identical, but *Jū* (sit) vs *Jìng* (end) suggests *Jūrán* focuses more on the *presence* of the unexpected fact, while *Jìngrán* focuses on the *outcome*.
