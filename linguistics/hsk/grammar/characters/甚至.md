# Character Breakdown: 甚至 (shènzhì)

The word **甚至** combines two characters that both relate to "extremes" and "limits," creating a conjunction that marks the furthest point of a logical progression.

## 1. 甚 (shèn)

* **Meaning**: Very, extreme, excessive.
* **Role**: Adverb of degree (mostly in Classical/formal Chinese).
* **Key Insight**: In modern spoken Mandarin, we usually use `很` (hěn) or `非常` (fēicháng) for "very." `甚` survives mostly in compounds or literary expressions.
* **Common Words**:
  * **甚**至 (shènzhì) - Even; go so far as to
  * **甚**好 (shènhǎo) - Very good (formal/literary)
  * 欺人太**甚** (qīrén tàishèn) - To bully others intolerably ("bullying people too explicitly/excessively")

## 2. 至 (zhì)

* **Meaning**: To arrive, to reach, until; most/extreme.
* **Role**: Verb (movement) or Superlative marker.
* **Key Insight**: Originally a picture of an arrow hitting the ground, indicating "arrival." It implies reaching a limit or a destination.
* **Common Words**:
  * **至**少 (zhìshǎo) - At least ("reaching the minimum")
  * **至**今 (zhìjīn) - Until now ("reaching today")
  * 冬**至** (Dōngzhì) - Winter Solstice ("Winter's peak/arrival")
  * **至**于 (zhìyú) - As for; as to ("reaching to")

## Synthesis

**甚至** = "Extreme" + "Reach"

Literally: "Reaching the extreme."

* It suggests that the statement being made has traveled along a scale of intensity and has now **arrived** at an **extreme** point.
* This explains why it translates to "even" or "go so far as to" — it emphasizes the distance covered from the baseline expectation.
