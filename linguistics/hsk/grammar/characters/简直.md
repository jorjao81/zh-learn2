# Character: 简直 (jiǎnzhí)

## Compound Breakdown: Simple + Straight

### 1. 简 (jiǎn) - Simple / Bamboo Slips
* **Radical:** 竹 (Bamboo).
* **Original Meaning:** Bamboo slips used for writing. Because writing on bamboo required brevity, it came to mean "simple," "concise," or "brief."
* **Common Words:**
  * **简单** (jiǎndān) - Simple.
  * **简历** (jiǎnlì) - Resume (Simple history).

### 2. 直 (zhí) - Straight / Direct
* **Visual:** An eye (目) looking straight ahead (sometimes depicted with a line representing straightness).
* **Meaning:** Straight (not bent), direct, vertical, honest.
* **Common Words:**
  * **直接** (zhíjiē) - Direct.
  * **一直** (yìzhí) - Always (straight through time).
  * **笔直** (bǐzhí) - Pen-straight (perfectly straight).

### The Combination: 简直 (jiǎnzhí)
Literally "Simple + Straight" or "Simply Direct."

The logic is: "I will speak simply and directly, without holding back."
* Therefore -> **"To put it bluntly"**
* Therefore -> **"Simply / Completely / Practically"**

It signals that the speaker is cutting through nuance to state the "naked truth" (even if that truth is an exaggeration).
