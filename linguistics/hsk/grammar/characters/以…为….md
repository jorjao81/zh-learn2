# 以…为… Character Breakdown

This grammar structure is a fossilized relic of Classical Chinese syntax.
To truly master it, you need to understand the archaic functions of its two
pillars.

## 以 (yǐ)

- **Core Concept:** **Instrumentality** (Using, Taking, By means of).
- **Etymology:** The ancient form depicts a person carrying an object, or
  perhaps a plow. It represents the idea of "taking hold of something to do
  something else."
- **Classical Function:** In Classical Chinese, **以** was the primary coverb
  for "with" or "using."
  - *Modern:* **用** 刀杀人 (Kill with a knife).
  - *Classical:* 杀人 **以** 刀 (Kill person **using** knife).
- **Role in "以 A 为 B":** It marks **A** as the *material* or *basis* for
  the judgment. "Taking A..."

## 为 (wéi)

- **Core Concept:** **Action / Identity** (To do, to make, to act as, to
  become).
- **Pronunciation:** Here it is **wéi** (2nd tone), related to "being" or
  "doing." (Not *wèi* - 4th tone - "for/sake of").
- **Etymology:** A hand guiding an elephant. This suggests "working,"
  "taming," or "making something happen."
- **Classical Function:** It acted as a copula (like "is") or a verb of
  transformation ("becomes").
  - *Examples:* 成为 (become), 认为 (deem/consider), 作为 (conduct/act as).
- **Role in "以 A 为 B":** It marks **B** as the *result*, *role*, or
  *status* assigned to A. "...[make it] function as B."

## The Logic of the Combination

When you combine them:
**以** (Take) + **A** (Topic) + **为** (Function as) + **B** (Role)

It is a compact, elegant way to define relationships.

- **民 (The People) 以 (Taking) 食 (Food) 为 (To Be) 天 (Heaven/God)**
  - *Translation:* The people view food as their god (their highest priority).
