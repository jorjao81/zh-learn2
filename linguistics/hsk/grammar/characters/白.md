# Character: 白 (bái)

## Core Meaning: White, Clear, Plain, Empty

### Etymology & Visuals

Originally, it depicted an acorn or a thumb, but it was borrowed very early to represent the color "white" (perhaps associated with the color of the silkworm or the clear light of the sun).

* Some interpretations link it to the sun (**日**) with a ray of light bursting forth, symbolizing clarity and brightness.

### Semantic Extensions

2. **Clear/Understand:** To make clear, or to state clearly.
    * **明白** (míngbai) = Bright + White = Clear/Understand.
    * **表白** (biǎobái) = Express + White = To confess (one's feelings/love).
3. **Plain/Empty:** Without adding anything.
    * **白开水** (báikāishuǐ) = Plain boiled water (water with nothing added).
    * **空白** (kòngbái) = Empty + White = Blank space.
4. **In Vain/Free:** (The grammatical usage). Without result or cost.

### Cultural Context

* **Red vs. White:** In Chinese culture, **Red** (红) is associated with weddings and celebrations, while **White** (白) is traditionally associated with funerals ("红白喜事" refers to weddings and funerals).
* **Politics:** "White" can also refer to "reactionary" or anti-communist in historical contexts (White Terror - 白色恐怖), contrasting with the "Red" (communist).
