## 2. 竟 (jìng) - The Unexpected End

  * **儿 (r)**: Person (bottom part).
* **Original Meaning**: A musical piece coming to its end/climax.

### Key Compounds

* **竟然 (jìngrán)**: Unexpectedly / to one's surprise (lit. "it ends up like this").
* **究竟 (jiūjìng)**: Outcome / what actually happened (lit. "investigate to the end").

## Synthesis: 毕竟 (End + End)

When you combine **毕** (complete) and **竟** (end), you get a "double-end" reinforcement.

* It isn't just the end of a sentence; it is the end of the *logic*.
* It signifies the point where analysis stops because you have hit the bedrock of truth.
