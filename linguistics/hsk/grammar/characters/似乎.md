**似** (sì): to resemble / similar / to seem

- **Etymology**: Phono-semantic compound. The radical is **亻** (person), suggesting attributes related to human appearance or comparison. The phonetic component is **以** (yǐ). Originally meant "image" or "likeness" (xiàng), it evolved to mean "to resemble" or "similar to."
- **Function**: Provides the core semantic meaning of "likeness" or "appearance" in the compound.

**乎** (hū): (classical particle)

- **Etymology**: An ideogram representing a breath or exhalation implies a pause or extension of sound. In Classical Chinese (Wenyanwen), **乎** was a high-frequency function word, used variously as a preposition (at/in), a question particle, or an exclamation.
- **Function**: In **似乎**, it acts as a suffix that grammaticalizes the root **似**. It shifts the meaning from the concrete "to resemble" (verb) to the abstract "seemingly" (adverb), adding a tone of estimation typical of classical grammar surviving in modern compounds.
