# 反正 (fǎnzhèng)

The logic of this word is transparent if you look at the components:
"Reverse" + "Upright."

## 1. 反 (fǎn) - Reverse, Opposite, Anti-

* **Pinyin:** fǎn
* **Meaning:** To turn over, to rebel, opposite, reverse side.
* **Origin:** The ancient script depicts a **hand (又)** turning over a
  **cliff/thin sheet (厂)**. It represents the action of flipping
  something over.

**Common associations:**

* **反对 (fǎnduì):** Oppose (reverse + correct/face)
* **相反 (xiāngfǎn):** Opposite/Contrary (mutual + reverse)
* **反应 (fǎnyìng):** Reaction (reverse + respond)

## 2. 正 (zhèng) - Upright, Correct, Positive

* **Pinyin:** zhèng (also zhēng in specific contexts)
* **Meaning:** Straight, upright, correct, positive (math/physics), main.
* **Origin:** A combination of a **foot (止)** marching towards a
  **target/city/line (一)**. The original meaning was a military
  march/conquest (hence "correction"), which evolved into "straight"
  and "upright."

**Common associations:**

* **正在 (zhèngzài):** In the process of (right/straight + at)
* **正常 (zhèngcháng):** Normal (correct + constant)
* **正确 (zhèngquè):** Correct (correct + true/solid)

## 3. Combination: 反 + 正

When combined into **反正**, the literal meaning is **"(whether) reverse
or upright"** or **"negative side or positive side."**

This creates the abstract meaning of **"regardless of the state,"**
**"in any case,"** or **"anyway."** It signifies that the outcome
encompasses all sides (both the *fan* and the *zheng*).
