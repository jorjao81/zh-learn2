# Character Breakdown: 岂不 (qǐbù)

## 岂 (qǐ)

* **Pinyin:** qǐ
* **Meaning:** How? / (Rhetorical question particle)
* **Structure:**
  * Traditional: 豈
  * Simplified: 岂

### Etymology of 岂

The Traditional character **豈** is a phonosemantic compound.

* **Semantic:** 豆 (dòu) - originally a vessel or standing drum.
* The character originally depicted a triumphant return of an army, involving
  beating drums (hence the component). It was borrowed early on for the
  sound *qǐ* to represent the abstract grammatical particle "how" (modal
  particle).

In Simplified Chinese, it was reduced to **岂** (`山` + `己`), which is
based on a cursive script form and loses the visual connection to the
"drum/vessel" etymology.

### Key Compounds

* **岂有此理** (qǐyǒucǐlǐ): "How can there be such a reason?" ->
  Preposterous! Outrageous!
* **岂敢** (qǐgǎn): "How would I dare?" (A humble refusal of praise or
  honor).
