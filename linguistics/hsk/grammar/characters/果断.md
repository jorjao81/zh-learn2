# Character Breakdown: 果断 (guǒduàn)

## 1. 果 (guǒ)

**Meaning**: Fruit; Result; Indeed; Resolute.

* **Pictograph**: Originally depicted a tree (`木`) with fruits (`田` shape on top) growing on it.
* **Semantic Shift**:
    1. Fruit (水果 - water fruit).
    2. Outcome/Result (后果 - after-fruit/consequence; 成果 - achievement fruit).
    3. **Realization/Certainty**: Because the fruit is the "reality" produced by the tree, `果` came to mean "indeed" or "really" (e.g., 果然 - as expected; 真的).
    4. **Firmness**: From certainty comes the meaning of "resolute" or "determined" (unwavering like a result that has already happened).
        * *Examples:* **果**敢 (guǒgǎn - courageous/daring), 杀伐**果**断.

In `果断`, `果` contributes the nuance of **firmness** and **outcome-oriented** action.

## 2. 断 (duàn)

**Meaning**: To cut; To break; To judge/decide.

* **Etymology**: The ancient form showed threads (`糸`) being cut by an axe (`斤`).
* **Semantic Shift**:
    1. Physical cutting/breaking (断裂 - to fracture; 弄断 - to break something).
    2. Abstract cutting (separation/interruption) (不断 - unceasing/continuous).
    3. **Decision/Judgment**: To "cut" through confusion or ambiguity is to decide. (e.g., 判**断** - judgment; 诊**断** - diagnosis; 决**断** - decision).

In `果断`, `断` provides the action of **making the cut** (the decision itself).

## Synthesis: 果断 (guǒduàn)

**Literal**: "Firm cutting" or "Result-oriented deciding."

The combination implies a decision that is made with the certainty of a result (`果`) and the sharpness of a cut (`断`), leaving no trailing "threads" of hesitation.
