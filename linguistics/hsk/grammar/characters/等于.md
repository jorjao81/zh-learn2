# Character Breakdown: 等于 (děngyú)

## 等 (děng)

**Core Meaning:** Rank, Class, Grade → Equal → To Wait.

### Etymology

The structure of **等** is phono-semantic:

* **Radical:** ⺮ (Bamboo `zhú`).
* **Phonetic/Component:** 寺 (Temple/Court `sì`).

Historically, **寺** did not just mean "temple" (Buddhist sense) but referred to **government offices** or courts (e.g., 大理寺 - the Supreme Court in imperial China).
The **Bamboo** radical refers to the **bamboo slips** used for keeping records.

Thus, **等** originally referred to the **arrangement of bamboo records by grade or rank** in a government office.

### Semantic Drift

1. **Rank/Grade**: (Original meaning) e.g., 等级 (děngjí - level/rank), 头等 (tóuděng - first class).
2. **Equal/Same**: From "same rank" comes "equal." e.g., 平等 (píngděng - equality), 同等 (tóngděng - same level).
3. **To Wait**: This seems unrelated, but linguistically it likely evolved from "steps/rank" → "sequence" → "awaiting one's turn/rank." e.g., 等一下 (děng yíxià - wait a moment).

## 于 (yú)

**Core Meaning:** In, At, To, From, By (Classical Preposition).

### Etymology

An ancient pictogram. Its form has evolved significantly, but it functions as one of the most fundamental grammatical particles in Classical Chinese.

### Function

In modern Mandarin, **于** rarely stands alone (unlike "at" or "to" in English). Instead, it survives as a suffix fused onto verbs to introduce a location, beneficiary, or target.

* **Locative**: 生**于** 1990 (Born **in** 1990).
* **Directional**: 等**于** (Equal **to**).
* **Comparative**: 高**于** (Higher **than**).
* **Source**: 源**于** (Originate **from**).

In **等于**, it acts as the connector that points the value of the subject *towards* the object.
