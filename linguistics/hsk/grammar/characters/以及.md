## The Combination: "Extending To"

When combined:
> **以** (With/Taking this) + **及** (Reaching that)
> = **"And extending to..."** or **"As well as..."**

It implies taking the main subject(s) and *extending* the scope to include one more item. This aligns with its grammatical usage, where the item following **以及** often feels like an extension or a final addition to the list, rather than a mathematically equal peer.
