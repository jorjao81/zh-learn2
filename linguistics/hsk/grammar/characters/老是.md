# Character Breakdown: 老是 (lǎoshì)

## 老 (lǎo)

* **Core Meaning:** Old, aged; experienced.
* **Etymology:** The character is an ideogram compound. The oracle bone script depicts an elderly person with long hair (top component 耂) leaning on a cane (lower component 匕, originally representing a spoon/person changing form, here stylized as a cane/support).
* **Semantic Extension to "Always":**
    How do we get from "old" to "always"?
  * *Old* $\to$ *Long-lasting / Enduring* $\to$ *Existing for a long time* $\to$ *Constant / Always*.
  * This grammaticalization path is common. Something that is "old" has been around forever.
  * In modern colloquial Chinese, **老** alone acts as an adverb meaning "always" or "very" (e.g., 老大 - eldest; 老好 - very good; 他老不来 - he takes forever to come).

## 是 (shì)

* **Core Meaning:** To be (copula); correct; right.
* **Etymology:** Originally related to "straight" or "correct" (sun over a foot/movement -> heading straight). It evolved into a demonstrative pronoun ("this") in Classical Chinese and later the primary copula ("is/am/are").
* **Function here:** In **老是**, **是** acts as a stabilizer or suffix for the adverb, likely reinforcing the *assertion* of the state. It doesn't carry the semantic weight of "to be" here, but rather solidifies **老** into a bisyllabic adverb suitable for varied rhythmic contexts.

**Compound Analysis:**
Together, **老是** suggests a state that is "old" (persistent) and "is" (asserted fact). It frames the action as a persistent, unchanging reality.
