## Character Structure

* **Radical**: 口 (kǒu) — mouth
* **Component**: 丂 (kǎo) — breath; obstruction; "ka" sound

## Etymology & Evolution

The character **可** is an ancient compound.

* The **口 (mouth)** represents speaking or singing.
* The **丂** component originally depicted breath seeking release or an obstruction.

In early texts, it represented the idea of "singing out" or "approving." When you approve of something, your mouth "releases" the breath/word effectively.

1. **Permission**: "To approve/listen to." (The mouth says yes).
2. **Possibility**: If something is permitted, it is *possible* (可以 - can).
3. **Adjective Marker**: If something "can" be X-ed, it is X-able.
    * **可爱** (kě'ài): Can be loved → Cute/Lovable
    * **可口** (kěkǒu): Can be mouthed → Tasty
4. **Emphatic Particle**: (The focus of HSK 5). The sense of "affirmation" or "approval" evolved into a modal marker strengthening the tone of the sentence. "It is *approvedly* true" → "It is *certainly* true."

## Mnemonic

A **mouth (口)** giving the "OK" (represented by the shape **丂** looking like a hook or confirm checkmark).
