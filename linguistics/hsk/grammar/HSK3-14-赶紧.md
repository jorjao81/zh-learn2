# HSK3-14 赶紧 (gǎnjǐn)

## Core Concept: Seizing the Critical Moment

While **赶紧 (gǎnjǐn)** translates to "hurriedly" or "quickly," its internal logic is best understood through its components: **赶** (to rush for/catch up) + **紧** (tight).

The semantic core is not just velocity (moving fast), but **urgency due to a closing window of opportunity**. You use 赶紧 when the situation is "tight" and action must be taken *now* to avoid a negative outcome or to catch a fleeting chance.

It functions as an **adverb (副词)**, appearing before the verb phrase.

## Syntactic Usage

The structure is standard for modal/time adverbs:

> Subject + **赶紧** + VP

### 1. The Imperative / Advisory (Future/Present)

Unlike some other "hurry" words, 赶紧 is extremely common in commands and suggestions.

* 快下雨了，我们**赶紧**走吧。
    *Kuài xiàyǔ le, wǒmen gǎnjǐn zǒu ba.*
    It's about to rain; let's hurry and leave (before we get soaked).
* 你病得这么厉害，**赶紧**去医院！
    *Nǐ bìng de zhème lìhai, gǎnjǐn qù yīyuàn!*
    You're so sick; go to the hospital right now!

### 2. The Narrative Reactive (Past)

In storytelling, it marks a prompt action taken in response to a new situation.

* 听说由于天气原因航班取消了，他**赶紧**去改签。
    *Tīngshuō yóuyú tiānqì yuányīn hángbān qǔxiāo le, tā gǎnjǐn qù gǎiqiān.*
    Hearing the flight was cancelled due to weather, he immediately/hurriedly went to change his ticket.

## Distinctions: The "Hurry" Spectrum

The confusion usually lies between **赶紧**, **赶快**, **连忙**, and **急忙**.

### 1. 赶紧 (gǎnjǐn) vs. 赶快 (gǎnkuài)

These are the closest siblings. Both can be used in commands (*Do it now!*).

* **赶快**: Focuses on **speed**. "Do it fast."
* **赶紧**: Focuses on **time pressure**. "Do it before it's too late."
* *Note:* In 90% of colloquial contexts, they are interchangeable.

### 2. The "No Commands" Constraint: 连忙 (liánmáng)

This is a critical distinction for learners.

* **连忙** describes a **reaction** that has already happened or is happening. It has a narrative flavor of "promptly responding to a stimulus."
* **Constraint**: You **cannot** use 连忙 in an imperative sentence.
  * ❌ *Wrong:* 你连忙去！ (You promptly go!)
  * ✅ *Right:* 你赶紧去！ (Hurry and go!)
  * ✅ *Right:* 看到老师来了，他连忙站了起来。 (Seeing the teacher arrive, he promptly stood up.)

### 3. Internal State: 急忙 (jímáng)

* **急** (anxious/impatient). This emphasizes the subject's **flustered state of mind** or hasty manner, rather than just the timing of the action.

## Pragmatic Notes

### The "Subjective" Urgency

赶紧 often implies the speaker's judgment that time is tight. When a mother tells a child "赶紧吃饭" (Hurry up and eat), it's not necessarily that the food is disappearing, but that the *schedule* is tight (e.g., school is starting).

### Collocations

* **赶紧 + [Verb] + [Direction/Result]**: 赶紧跑 (run quickly), 赶紧做完 (finish quickly).
* **趁** (chèn, taking advantage of) ... **赶紧**: A classic pattern.
  * 趁热**赶紧**吃。
  * *Chèn rè gǎnjǐn chī.*
  * Eat it quickly while it's hot. (Perfectly captures the "closing window" nuance).
