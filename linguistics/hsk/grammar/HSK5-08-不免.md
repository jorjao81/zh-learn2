# HSK5-08 不免 (bùmiǎn)

HSK 3.0 Level 5 | Grammar Point: 五08 | Mood Adverbs

The adverb **不免** (bùmiǎn) indicates that a certain result is a natural, inevitable consequence of a preceding situation. It maps closely to the English concepts of "unavoidably," "inevitably," or "cannot help but."

## 1. The Core Concept: Natural Consequence

Unlike other words for "must" or "have to," **不免** deals with **causality**, not obligation. It describes a cause-and-effect relationship where the outcome is practically guaranteed by the circumstances.

Think of it as: "Given X, Y naturally follows."

* **Circumstance:** 第一次离家生活 (Living away from home for the first time)
* **Natural Consequence:** 不免想家 (inevitably miss home)

It is objective rather than subjective; it describes how things *are*, not what someone *decides* to do.

## 2. Syntax and Usage

**不免** is a **Mood Adverb (语气副词)**.

### Structure

> Situation/Context + Subject + **不免** + [Verb / Adjective / Phrase]

The predicate following **不免** usually describes a psychological state, an emotion, or a natural reaction.

* 看到以前的照片，**不免**想起过去的时光。
    *Kàndào yǐqián de zhàopiàn, **bùmiǎn** xiǎngqǐ guòqù de shíguāng.*
    Seeing old photos, one **inevitably** thinks of the past.

* 由于缺乏经验，刚开始做**不免**会犯错。
    *Yóuyú quēfá jīngyàn, gāng kāishǐ zuò **bùmiǎn** huì fàncuò.*
    Due to lack of experience, starting out one will **unavoidably** make mistakes.

### Constraints

1. **Not for Volition:** You cannot use **不免** for intentional actions planned by the subject.
    * ❌ 明天我不免去北京。 (Wrong: "I inevitably go to Beijing tomorrow.")
    * ✅ 明天我不得不去北京。 (Right: "I have no choice but to go to Beijing tomorrow.")

2. **Not for "Must":** It doesn't mean "must" in the sense of a command or requirement. It means "bound to happen."

## 3. Comparison: 不免 vs. 难免

These two are the most common source of confusion. Both translate to "hard to avoid" or "inevitable," and they share the character **免** (to avoid).

| Feature | 不免 (bùmiǎn) | 难免 (nánmiǎn) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Literal Meaning** | "Not avoided" | "Hard to avoid" |
| **Part of Speech** | **Adverb only** | **Adjective** (can act as Adverb) |
| **Usage** | Modifies the verb/predicate directly. | Can be a predicate itself: "This is hard to avoid." |
| **Nuance** | Emphasizes the **result** happening. (It *will* happen). | Emphasizes the **difficulty** of avoiding it. (It is *likely* to happen). |

### The "Adjective Test"

Only **难免** can stand alone or act as a predicate.

* 年轻人犯错误是**难免**的。 (Mistakes by young people are **hard to avoid/inevitable**.)
  * ✅ Valid. Here, 难免 is the predicate.
* 年轻人犯错误是**不免**的。
  * ❌ Invalid. 不免 cannot be an adjective.

### Interchangeability

When functioning as an adverb before a verb, they are often interchangeable, though **不免** feels slightly more formal and affirmative (it *does* happen), while **难免** suggests high probability.

* 旧地重游，**不免**有些伤感。 (Returning to an old haunt, one is **inevitably** a bit sad.) — *Focus: The sadness happened.*
* 旧地重游，**难免**有些伤感。 (Returning to an old haunt, it is **hard to avoid** being a bit sad.) — *Focus: Sadness is understandable/expected.*

## 4. Collocations and Register

**不免** is often found in written or slightly formal spoken Chinese. It frequently collocates with verbs of cognition and emotion, or adjectives describing states.

* **不免有些** (bùmiǎn yǒuxiē) + [Adjective]: inevitably a bit... (nervous, disappointed, worried)
* **不免让人** (bùmiǎn ràng rén) + [Verb]: inevitably makes people... (worry, suspect, think)

> 听到这个消息，大家心里**不免**有些担忧。
> *Tīngdào zhège xiāoxi, dàjiā xīnli **bùmiǎn** yǒuxiē dānyōu.*
