## The Core Concept: "Side by Side" -> "Reinforcement"

The character **并** primarily means "combine" or "side by side."
1. **Conjunction:** It links two verbs/clauses side by side ("and").
2. **Adverb:** It reinforces a negative statement. This is the **tricky HSK 3 usage**.

## 1. Emphatic Negation (The "Actually" Usage)

This is the most critical usage for learners to master at the intermediate level. **并** is placed before a negative word (**不** or **没/没有**) to emphasize that a certain fact or assumption is **not true**.

It conveys a tone of "contrary to what you might expect" or "contrary to what was said."

**Structure:** `Subject + 并 + 不 / 没(有) + Verb/Adj`

* **大家都以为他生气了，其实他并没有生气。**
  * *Dàjiā dōu yǐwéi tā shēngqì le, qíshí tā bìng méiyǒu shēngqì.*
  * Everyone thought he was angry, but actually, he was **not** angry **at all**.
  * *(Context: Correcting a false assumption.)*
* **这个任务并不容易。**
  * *Zhè ge rènwu bìng bù róngyì.*
  * This task is **actually not** easy.
  * *(Context: It might look easy, but I'm telling you it isn't.)*
* **我并不认识他。**
  * *Wǒ bìng bú rènshi tā.*
  * I **really don't** know him.
  * *(Context: You imply I know him, but I simply don't.)*

### Why use it?
If you remove **并**, the sentence remains grammatically correct but loses its "punch."
* **他不胖。** (He isn't fat.) -> Simple fact.
* **他并不胖。** (He isn't [actually] fat.) -> Defensive/Corrective. Maybe someone called him fat, and you are disagreeing.

## 2. Connecting Actions (The "And" Usage)

This is the HSK 4 usage (四19), but it's worth noting here. **并** connects two verbs or clauses, often suggesting that the two actions happen together or logically follow one another. It is more formal than **和** (which connects nouns).

**Structure:** `Verb Phrase 1 + 并(且) + Verb Phrase 2`

* **他们讨论并通过了这个计划。**
  * *Tāmen tǎolùn bìng tōngguò le zhège jìhuà.*
  * They discussed **and** passed this plan.
* **请阅读并签字。**
  * *Qǐng yuèdú bìng qiānzì.*
  * Please read **and** sign.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake:** Using 并 to connect nouns like "Apple and Banana".
* *Error:* 我喜欢苹果并香蕉。
* *Correction:* 我喜欢苹果**和**香蕉。
* *Rule:* **和** (hé) connects nouns. **并** (bìng) connects verbs/clauses (or reinforces negation).

**Mistake:** Using 并 in a positive adjective sentence for emphasis.
* *Error:* 这是一个并好的主意。
* *Correction:* 这是一个**很好的**主意。
* *Rule:* As an intensifier, **并** is almost exclusively used with **negatives** (并不/并没有). You rarely hear "并好" or "并去".
