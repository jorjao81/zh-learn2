# HSK 5 Grammar: 明明 (míngmíng)

| Category | Chinese | Pinyin | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adverb (Mood) | 明明 | míngmíng | obviously, plainly, undoubtedly (often with counter-expectation) |

## The "Counter-Factual" Evidential

While dictionaries translate **明明** as "obviously" or "plainly," this misses its primary pragmatic function. **明明** is not just about objective clarity (like 显然); it is an **adversative evidential marker**.

It emphasizes that a fact is blatantly obvious, usually to highlight a stark contradiction with:

1. What is actually happening.
2. What someone is saying.
3. What typically follows such a fact.

Think of it not just as "clearly," but as **"clearly X, and yet [contrary reality]..."**

## Pragmatic Usage

### 1. Pointing out Absurdity or Hypocrisy

This is the most common usage. The speaker points to an indisputable fact to show that the current situation is illogical or that someone is lying.

* **明明**是你不对，你为什么还发脾气？
  * (It is) **plainly** you who are in the wrong, (so) why are you losing your temper?
  * *Implication: The reality (you are wrong) makes your action (getting angry) absurd.*

* 他**明明**不喜欢吃辣，却点了一个最辣的菜。
  * He **clearly** doesn't like spicy food, yet he ordered the spiciest dish.
  * *Note: Using 显然 (xiǎnrán - evidently) here would sound like a dry observation. Using 明明 adds a tone of surprise or confusion: "What is he doing?"*

### 2. Reinforcing a Forgotten Truth

It can be used to remind someone (or oneself) of a fact that seems to have been ignored.

* 这**明明**是好事，大家为什么都不高兴呢？
  * This is **undoubtedly** a good thing; why is everyone unhappy?

## Syntactic Patterns

Because **明明** sets up a contrast, it is frequently paired with adversative conjunctions or adverbs in the second clause.

### The "Plainly... Yet..." Construction
>
> **Subject + 明明 + [Fact], (但是/却/偏偏) + [Contradiction]**

* **偏偏 (piānpian)** is a particularly strong collocate. It emphasizes the "perverseness" of the outcome.
  * 我**明明**定好了闹钟，**偏偏**没响。
  * I **definitely** set the alarm, (but as luck would have it) it just didn't go off.

## Synonyms and Distinctions

### vs. 显然 (xiǎnrán)

* **显然** is **objective**. It describes a deduction or visible state. It is used in academic writing, news reports, and neutral descriptions.
* **明明** is **subjective and emotive**. It is almost exclusively used in spoken or narrative contexts where the speaker's attitude (surprise, indignation, confusion) is relevant.

| Context | Sentence | Nuance |
|---|---|---|
| **Objective Observation** | 现在的经济形势**显然**不好。 | (Analytical) The economic situation is evidently poor. |
| **Subjective Complaint** | 钱**明明**够用了，你为什么还要借？ | (Emotional) We plainly have enough money; why are you still borrowing? |

### vs. 分明 (fēnmíng)

* **分明** is clearer/sharper than 明明 but more literary. It can function as an adjective ("distinct/clear boundary") or an adverb. As an adverb, it is similar to 明明 but sounds more dramatic or storytelling-esque.

## Common Errors

### 1. Using it for simple observation

* 🚫 Look, the sky is **míngmíng** blue. (看，天**明明**是蓝的。)
* ✅ Look, the sky is blue. (看，天是蓝的。)
* *Correction:* Unless you are arguing with someone who claims the sky is green, do not use 明明. It carries a disputational tone.

### 2. Word Order

As an adverb, it appears **after** the subject or **before** the subject (as a topic marker), but always before the verb/predicate.

* 他**明明**知道... (He clearly knows...)
* **明明**是他先动手的... (It was clearly him who moved first...)
