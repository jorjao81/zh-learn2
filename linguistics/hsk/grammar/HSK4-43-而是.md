# HSK 4 Grammar: 而是 (érshì)

## 1. Overview

| Category | Connection |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pinyin** | érshì |
| **Meaning** | ...but rather...; ...but... |
| **Structure** | 不是 A，**而是** B |
| **HSK Level** | 4 |
| **Grammar ID** | 四43 |

**而是** (érshì) is almost exclusively used in the pattern **不是……，而是……** (not..., but...). It is used to negate a misconception (A) and immediately replace it with the correct information (B).

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### Correction of Presupposition

This construction is a tool for **corrective focus**. The speaker assumes the listener might believe "A" is true, or "A" is the obvious assumption. The speaker explicitly rejects "A" (*búshì*) and asserts "B" (*érshì*).

* **Syntactic Role**: **而** acts as the connector (but/and), and **是** functions as the copula (is) or simply emphasizes the affirmation.

## 3. Usage & Examples

### Basic Structure
>
> **Subject** + **不是** (Option A)，**而是** (Option B).

* **It's not that I don't want to go, but (rather) that I don't have time.**
  * 我**不是**不想去，**而是**没时间。
  * (Wǒ **búshì** bù xiǎng qù, **érshì** méi shíjiān.)
  * *Note: Official HSK example. It corrects the motive.*

* **This isn't my book, but his.**
  * 这**不是**我的书，**而是**他的。
  * (Zhè **búshì** wǒ de shū, **érshì** tā de.)

### Emphasis on the "Real" Reason

* **The one who's wrong about this isn't me, but him.**
  * 这件事错的**不是**我，**而是**他。
  * (Zhè jiàn shì cuò de **búshì** wǒ, **érshì** tā.)

## 4. Nuances and Traps

### Is it "But"?

Learners often want to use **但是** (dànshì) here.

* *English*: "It is not red, but blue."
* *Chinese*: "它不是红色的，**而是**蓝色的。" (Correct)
* *Chinese*: "它不是红色的，但是蓝色的。" (Incorrect/Awkward)

**Rule of Thumb**: If the sentence follows the logic "Not X, but Y" (where X and Y are mutually exclusive options for the same slot), use **不是...而是...**.
If the sentence admits X is true but offers a counterpoint Y, use **虽然...但是...** (Although X, but Y).

* *Scenario*: Correcting a color.
  * "It's not red, it's blue." -> **而是** (It can't be both).
* *Scenario*: Describing a car.
  * "It's not fast, but it's cheap." -> **但是** (It is both "not fast" and "cheap" simultaneously).

## 5. Summary Table

| Expression | Logic | English Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **不是 A，而是 B** | A is False, B is True | Not A, but (rather) B |
| **虽然 A，但是 B** | A is True, B is True (unexpectedly) | Although A, B |
