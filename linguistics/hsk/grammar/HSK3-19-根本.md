| Category | Level | Character | Pinyin | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mood Adverb / Noun | HSK 3 (三19) | 根本 | gēnběn | at all; simply; fundamentally; root |

## The Core Concept: "Root & Stem" -> "Foundation"

**根本** (gēnběn) refers to the roots of a plant.

* **Noun:** The foundation, the base.
* **Adverb:** "From the root," "Fundamentally," or (with negatives) "Not even at the root" -> **Not at all**.

## 1. Emphatic Negative: "Not at all"

This is the most frequent conversational usage. It emphasizes that something is completely untrue or impossible, right from the start.

**Structure:** `Subject + 根本 + 不/没(有) + Verb/Adj`

* **我根本不认识他。**
  * *Wǒ gēnběn bú rènshi tā.*
  * I don't know him **at all**. (It's not that I know him a little; I have zero knowledge of him).
* **他根本没去过北京。**
  * *Tā gēnběn méi qùguo Běijīng.*
  * He has **never even** been to Beijing (contrary to what you might think).
* **这个问题根本解决不了。**
  * *Zhège wèntí gēnběn jiějué bùliǎo.*
  * This problem **simply** cannot be solved.

## 2. Fundamental / Basic (Adjective/Noun)

Used to describe the root cause or essential nature of something.

* **这是最根本的原因。**
  * *Zhè shì zuì gēnběn de yuányīn.*
  * This is the most **fundamental** reason.
* **我们需要从根本上解决问题。**
  * *Wǒmen xūyào cóng gēnběn shang jiějué wèntí.*
  * We need to solve the problem from the **root**.

## Comparison: 根本 (gēnběn) vs. 完全 (wánquán)

Both can mean "completely."

| Word | Nuance | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **完全** | "Wholly / Entirely" | Focuses on *completeness* (100%). Used with positives and negatives. |
| **根本** | "Radically / At the root" | Focuses on *emphasis*. Almost exclusively used with **negatives** in spoken Chinese ("not at all"). |

* **我完全同意。** (I completely agree.) -> Positive usage. **根本** is rarely used here ("我根本同意" sounds weird/wrong unless emphasizing "fundamentally").
* **我完全不同意** vs **我根本不同意** -> Both mean "I totally disagree," but **根本** feels more dismissive ("I disagree from the root").
