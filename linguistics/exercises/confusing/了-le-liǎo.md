# 了 (le vs liǎo)

One of the most important distinctions in Chinese. Most learners only know
*le* and miss *liǎo* entirely.

## 了 (le) — Particle

A grammatical marker with **no independent meaning**. Two main functions:

**1. Completed action** (after verb):

我吃**了**饭。
*I ate.* / *I've eaten.*

**2. Change of state** (end of sentence):

下雨**了**。
*It's raining now.* (it wasn't before)

我懂**了**。
*Now I understand.* (I didn't before)

*Le* is **unstressed**, almost swallowed. Native speakers barely pronounce it.

## 了 (liǎo) — Verb/Complement

A **real word** meaning "to finish" or indicating ability. Always stressed.

**1. Potential complement** (V + 得/不 + 了):

吃得**了** / 吃不**了**
*can finish eating* / *can't finish eating*

这么多菜，我一个人吃不**了**。
*So much food, I can't finish it alone.*

**2. In compounds**:

- 了解 (liǎojiě) — to understand
- 了不起 (liǎobuqǐ) — amazing, remarkable
- 了结 (liǎojié) — to settle, to conclude

## The Test

**If 得 or 不 comes immediately before 了, it's always *liǎo*.**

| Pattern     | Reading | Example  | Meaning          |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| V + 了      | le      | 吃了     | ate              |
| V + 不了    | liǎo    | 吃不了   | can't finish     |
| V + 得了    | liǎo    | 吃得了   | can finish       |
| Sentence 了 | le      | 太晚了   | it's gotten late |

## Common Mistakes

- 受不了 (shòubùliǎo) — can't stand it → **liǎo**, not *le*
- 来不了 (láibùliǎo) — can't come → **liǎo**, not *le*
- 忘不了 (wàngbùliǎo) — can't forget → **liǎo**, not *le*

When you see 不了, train yourself to say *bùliǎo*, not *bùle*.
