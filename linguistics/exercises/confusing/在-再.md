# 在 vs 再

Identical pronunciation. Different characters. Learners confuse them
constantly — especially when typing with pinyin input.

## 在 (zài) — Location & Ongoing Action

**Core meaning**: WHERE something is, or that something IS HAPPENING.

**1. Location** (at, in):

我**在**北京。 — *I'm in Beijing.*

书**在**桌子上。 — *The book is on the table.*

**2. Progressive aspect** (currently doing):

我**在**吃饭。 — *I'm eating.*

他**在**睡觉。 — *He's sleeping.*

**3. Existence**:

他不**在**。 — *He's not here.*

**Mental check**: Can you replace it with "at" or "-ing"? → **在**

## 再 (zài) — Repetition & Sequence

**Core meaning**: AGAIN, or THEN (in a sequence).

**1. Again**:

请**再**说一遍。 — *Please say it again.*

**再**来一杯。 — *One more cup.* / *Another round.*

**2. Then** (after something else):

先吃饭，**再**工作。 — *Eat first, then work.*

**3. Anymore** (with negation):

我**再**也不去了。 — *I'll never go again.*

**Mental check**: Can you replace it with "again" or "then"? → **再**

## Quick Comparison

| Question to ask       | Answer | Character |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Where?                | here   | 在        |
| What's happening now? | -ing   | 在        |
| Do it again?          | again  | 再        |
| What next?            | then   | 再        |

## The Killer Sentence

我**在**这里等你，你**再**来一次。
*I'm [waiting] here for you; come again.*

Both *zài* in one sentence — but totally different meanings and characters.
