# 己 vs 已 vs 巳

The classic "three snakes" — even native speakers mix these up when writing
by hand. The difference is a single stroke.

## Visual Key

Look at the **top-right corner**:

```text
己  →  open (the stroke stops short)
已  →  half-closed (stroke extends but doesn't touch)
巳  →  closed (fully enclosed)
```

Traditional mnemonic: **己开已半巳封口** — "己 open, 已 half, 巳 sealed"

## 己 (jǐ) — Self

The most common of the three. Means "oneself" or "personal."

- 自己 (zìjǐ) — oneself ← **you will write this hundreds of times**
- 知己 (zhījǐ) — a close friend who understands you
- 克己 (kèjǐ) — self-discipline

> 管好你自己。
> *Mind your own business.*

## 已 (yǐ) — Already

Indicates completion. Often paired with 经 to form 已经.

- 已经 (yǐjīng) — already ← **extremely common**
- 已知 (yǐzhī) — already known (math/science term)
- 早已 (zǎoyǐ) — long since, long ago

> 我已经吃过了。
> *I've already eaten.*

## 巳 (sì) — Earthly Branch (Snake)

Rare in modern usage. Only appears in:

- 巳时 (sìshí) — 9-11 AM in traditional timekeeping
- 巳蛇 (sìshé) — the Snake in the Chinese zodiac

Unless you're discussing the zodiac or classical texts, you won't need this.

## Common Mistakes

| Wrong    | Right    | Sentence                   |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| 自已     | 自**己** | 我自己做 (I do it myself)  |
| 己经     | **已**经 | 已经到了 (already arrived) |

**Frequency**: 己 and 已 are both extremely common. 巳 is rare.
When in doubt between 己 and 已, ask: does it mean "self" or "already"?
