significantly in register (formality), structure, and scope.
**打算 (dǎsuàn)** is informal and focuses on *intention*, whereas
**计划 (jìhuà)** is formal and focuses on *systematic arrangement*.

    * *Function*: In this compound, it acts similarly to a "dummy verb" or a
      generalized handle for action (like "do" or "make" in English), making
      the tone active and colloquial.
