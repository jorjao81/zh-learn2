# Distinguishing 怨, 恕, and 怒

All three characters share the **心 (xīn)** radical at the bottom, functioning as the **semantic component** indicating they represent internal states, emotions, or movements of the "heart-mind." To differentiate them, we must analyze the upper components.

## 1. 怨 (yuàn) — Resentment / Grudge

* **Structure**: Phono-semantic compound (形声).
  * **Semantic**: 心 (xīn) — Heart/Mind.
  * **Phonetic & Semantic**: 夗 (yuàn).
* **Linguistic Breakdown**:
  * The component **夗** (yuàn) provides the sound.
  * Semantically, it depicts a person lying down or turning over in bed. This contributes to the meaning: a state of being unsettled, "curled up," or tossing and turning with dissatisfaction.
  * **怨** represents a "cold" emotion. It is not a sudden outburst, but a lingering bitterness or a feeling of being wronged that one "carries" in the heart.
* **Key Meanings**: Resentment, complaint, grudge.
* **Common Words**:
  * **怨恨 (yuànhèn)**: Resentment; hatred born from a sense of injustice.
  * **抱怨 (bàoyuàn)**: To complain; to grumble about something.
  * **埋怨 (mányuàn)**: To blame; to complain (often about someone close).

## 2. 怒 (nù) — Anger / Fury

* **Structure**: Phono-semantic compound (形声).
  * **Semantic**: 心 (xīn) — Heart/Mind.
  * **Phonetic & Semantic**: 奴 (nú).
* **Linguistic Breakdown**:
  * The component **奴** (nú) provides the sound (tone shift from 2nd to 4th).
  * Semantically, **奴** means "slave" or "servant." Chinese philosophy often views anger (怒) as a state where the heart-mind is "enslaved" by external circumstances or a loss of self-control.
  * It is a "hot," active, and often explosive emotion.
* **Key Meanings**: Anger, rage, fury.
* **Common Words**:
  * **愤怒 (fènnù)**: Indignation; anger.
  * **发怒 (fānù)**: To lose one's temper.
  * **激怒 (jīnù)**: To infuriate; to provoke.

## 3. 恕 (shù) — Forgiveness / Empathy

* **Structure**: Phono-semantic compound (形声) / Ideogrammic compound (会意).
  * **Semantic**: 心 (xīn) — Heart/Mind.
  * **Phonetic & Semantic**: 如 (rú).
* **Linguistic Breakdown**:
  * The component **如** (rú) historically provides the sound (though the pronunciation has drifted in modern Mandarin, the connection remains in dialects and historical phonology).
  * Semantically, **如** means "as" or "like."
  * This combination creates a powerful ideogram: **"As [one's own] heart."**
  * This is a central concept in Confucianism (*shù*): to treat the hearts of others as you would treat your own. It is the definition of empathy and the prerequisite for forgiveness.
* **Key Meanings**: Forgiveness, tolerance, empathy.
* **Common Words**:
  * **宽恕 (kuānshù)**: To forgive; to pardon.
  * **恕我直言 (shù wǒ zhíyán)**: "Forgive my bluntness" (Pardon me for speaking frankly).
  * **仁恕 (rénshù)**: Benevolence and forgiveness.
