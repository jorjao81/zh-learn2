# 学习

## Definition

1. **verb** to study; to learn
2. **noun** study; learning (the process of acquiring knowledge)

## 1. Core Meaning

The word **学习** combines two complementary actions in the learning process:

- **学 (xué)**: To learn, to acquire new knowledge or skills
- **习 (xí)**: To practice, to review, to make habitual through repetition

Together, **学习** captures the complete cycle of learning: first acquiring
knowledge (学), then reinforcing it through practice (习). This reflects the
Chinese pedagogical philosophy that true learning requires both reception and
active reinforcement.

## 2. Character Decomposition

| Character | Pinyin | Meaning     | Components                             |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 学        | xué    | to learn    | 子 (child) + 冖 (roof) — being taught  |
| 习        | xí     | to practice | From 習: 羽 (wings) + 白 (white)       |

The character 学 originally depicted a child learning under guidance.
The character 习 (習) showed young birds repeatedly flapping their wings —
the essence of practice through repetition.

## 3. Usage Patterns

### A. Transitive Verb (with Object)

Used when specifying what is being studied.

### B. Intransitive Verb (without Object)

## 4. Structural Analysis

**学习** functions as both a verb and a noun in Mandarin:

- **As verb**: Can take direct objects (学习中文) or be used
  intransitively (在学习)
- **As noun**: Often appears in compound nouns (学习方法, 学习成绩)
  or as subject/object
- **Verb-Object flexibility**: Can be split by aspect markers
  (学了习 is less common but grammatical in some contexts)

The word belongs to the class of disyllabic verbs that emerged during the
classical-to-modern Chinese transition, combining two related monosyllabic
verbs into a more formal compound.

## 7. Comparison

### 学习 vs 学

| Feature   | 学习 (xuéxí)      | 学 (xué)       |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Register  | Neutral/formal    | Colloquial     |
| Syllables | Disyllabic        | Monosyllabic   |
| As noun   | Common (学习成绩) | Less common    |
| Formality | Written & spoken  | Mainly spoken  |
| Example   | 我在学习中文      | 我在学中文     |

Both are correct, but **学习** sounds slightly more formal or complete,
while **学** alone is more conversational.

## 8. Common Errors

### 1. Overusing 学习 in Casual Speech

In everyday conversation, native speakers often use just 学 for simplicity.

❌ 你在学习什么？(overly formal for casual chat)
✅ 你在学什么？(natural in conversation)

### 2. Confusing with 读书

**学习** is broader (any learning), while **读书** specifically means
"to read books" or "to attend school."

❌ 我去图书馆学习书。
✅ 我去图书馆看书。 or 我去图书馆学习。

## 9. Notes

- **HSK Level**: HSK 1
- **Frequency**: Very common
- **Register**: Neutral; appropriate in both formal and informal contexts
- **Cultural note**: 学习 carries positive connotations in Chinese culture,
  where lifelong learning (终身学习) is highly valued
