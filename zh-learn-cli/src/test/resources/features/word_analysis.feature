Feature: Chinese Word Analysis
  As a Chinese language learner
  I want to analyze Chinese words using the Dummy Provider
  So that I can understand their pinyin, meaning, structure, usage, and cultural context

  Scenario: Analyze a Chinese word using dummy provider
    Given the ZH Learn application is available
    When I analyze the word "你好" using provider "dummy"
    Then the analysis should be successful
#    And the pinyin should be "dummy-pinyin-你好"
#    And the definition meaning should be "Dummy meaning for 你好"
#    And the structural decomposition should be "Dummy structural decomposition for 你好: Component breakdown with radicals and meanings."
#    And the explanation should be "Dummy explanation for 你好: This word has ancient origins and is commonly used in daily conversation. It has cultural significance in Chinese society."
