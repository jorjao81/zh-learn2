# Feature Specification: Chinese Usage Distinction Exercise (填空辨析练习)

## 1. Feature Name and Description

**Feature Name:** Usage Distinction Fill-in-the-Blank Exercise (同义词语境辨析填空练习)

**Description:** An interactive exercise type that helps Chinese language learners distinguish between semantically 
similar terms (近义词) by requiring them to select all appropriate word choices that correctly fit a given sentence 
context. This exercise addresses the common challenge of choosing between words with overlapping meanings but different 
usage patterns, collocations, or register levels.

## 2. User Story with Acceptance Criteria

**User Story:**
As a Chinese language learner studying intermediate to advanced vocabulary (HSK 4-6 level), I want to practice 
distinguishing between similar terms in authentic sentence contexts so that I can develop nuanced understanding of 
word usage patterns and improve my accuracy in written and spoken expression.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Exercise presents a single Chinese sentence with exactly one blank space (标记空格)
- **AC2:** System provides 2-6 Chinese word/phrase options as potential answers
- **AC3:** At least one option must be semantically and grammatically correct
- **AC4:** Multiple correct answers are permitted when multiple options fit the context
- **AC5:** User must select ALL correct options to receive full credit (全选正确)
- **AC6:** Partial credit is not awarded - exercise is marked correct only when all valid options are selected
- **AC7:** System provides immediate feedback explaining why each option is correct/incorrect

## 3. Exercise Mechanics and Validation Rules

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Presentation Format:** Single sentence display with clearly marked blank position
- **Selection Interface:** Multi-select checkbox interface for answer options
- **Validation Logic:** 
  - Compare user selections against predefined correct answer set
  - Require exact match (no partial credit)
  - Validate grammatical correctness and semantic appropriateness
- **Feedback System:** 
  - Immediate result indication (正确/错误)
  - Detailed explanation for each option choice
  - Contextual usage notes for incorrect selections

**Validation Rules:**
1. **Linguistic Validation:** Options must be grammatically compatible with sentence structure
2. **Semantic Validation:** Correct options must maintain logical sentence meaning
3. **Register Validation:** Options must match appropriate formality level
4. **Collocation Validation:** Options must form natural word combinations with surrounding context

## 4. Learning Objectives and Pedagogical Rationale

**Primary Learning Objectives:**
- **Contextual Discrimination:** Develop ability to distinguish subtle meaning differences between synonymous terms

but struggle with precise usage. By requiring selection of ALL correct options, the exercise:

- Mirrors authentic language use where multiple expressions may be appropriate
- Builds confidence in recognizing acceptable variation in Chinese expression

**Target Proficiency Levels:**
- **Primary:** HSK 4-5 (Intermediate)
- **Secondary:** HSK 6 (Advanced)
- **TOCFL Equivalent:** B1-B2 levels
