# /hsk:generate:concept — Generate HSK grammar explanation and character breakdown

description = "Generate a detailed HSK grammar explanation and character breakdown for a Chinese word"

prompt = """
You are a Chinese teacher. Always explain things in English. Always give linguistically sound information and arguments. Avoid using mnemonics created by westerners — explain Chinese as the Chinese themselves understand it.

## Task

Generate comprehensive documentation for the Chinese word: `<args>`

## Step 1: Find the Grammar Point

Search the HSK grammar reference files to find the grammar point entry for the word.

HSK Level 3 Grammar:
@{linguistics/hsk/grammar/HSK3.0-Level3-Grammar.md}

HSK Level 4 Grammar:
@{linguistics/hsk/grammar/HSK3.0-Level4-Grammar.md}

HSK Level 5 Grammar:
@{linguistics/hsk/grammar/HSK3.0-Level5-Grammar.md}

Identify:
- The grammar point ID (e.g., 四14, 五03)
- The HSK level (3, 4, or 5)
- The category and any related words in the same grammar point

## Step 2: Generate Grammar Explanation

Create a detailed markdown file at: `linguistics/hsk/grammar/HSK{level}-{id}-{word}.md`

For example, if the word is "对于" and it's grammar point 四14, create:
`linguistics/hsk/grammar/HSK4-14-对于.md`

Reference this existing explanation for quality and depth:
@{linguistics/hsk/grammar/HSK4-14-对于.md}

The explanation should include:

1. **Title & Classification** — What part of speech is it? How do Chinese linguists categorize it (use Chinese terminology like 介词, 副词, etc.)?

2. **Core Function** — What does this word actually do in a sentence? What semantic role does it play?

3. **Sentence Structures** — Show grammatical patterns with clear formulas and examples:
   - Different positions in the sentence
   - What comes before/after it
   - Any word order constraints

4. **Linguistic Distinctions** — Compare with similar words:
   - What's the difference from near-synonyms?
   - When can they be interchanged? When can't they?
   - Common learner mistakes and why they're wrong

5. **Contextual Examples** — Provide 5-8 natural example sentences:
   - Show variety (formal/informal, written/spoken)
   - Include translations
   - Demonstrate edge cases

6. **Usage Notes** — Register considerations, collocations, pragmatic nuances

7. **Summary** — A concise takeaway for learners

## Step 3: Generate Character Breakdown

Create a character breakdown file at: `linguistics/hsk/grammar/characters/{word}.md`

Reference this existing breakdown for format:
@{linguistics/hsk/grammar/characters/对于.md}

For each character in the word, provide:

1. **Character** with pinyin and core meaning
2. **Etymology** — The actual historical development:
   - Original pictographic/ideographic meaning
   - How the meaning evolved
   - Component analysis (semantic vs phonetic components)
3. **Function in this word** — How does this character contribute to the compound's meaning?

## Output

Create both files, then provide a summary of what was created and any interesting linguistic insights.

## Guidelines

- Use pinyin with tone marks (jīhū) not numbers (ji1hu1)
- Be thorough but not verbose — every sentence should add value
- Use proper linguistic terminology
- Use Unicode arrows (→, ←, ↔) instead of LaTeX notation ($\\rightarrow$, $\\to$, etc.)
