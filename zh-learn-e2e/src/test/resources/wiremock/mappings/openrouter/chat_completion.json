The original meaning was \\\"weeds growing among crops\\\" which evolved to mean \\\"filthy\\\" or \\\"dirty\\\" as weeds were seen as contaminating the crops. This semantic evolution from agricultural contamination to general uncleanliness is common in Chinese characters.</p>\\n\\n<h3>The Semantic Evolution</h3>\\n<p><b>\\\"Weeds among grain\\\" → \\\"dirty/filthy\\\" → \\\"obscene/debauchery\\\"</b></p>\\n<p>The character evolved from its agricultural origins to describe anything unclean or morally impure.
