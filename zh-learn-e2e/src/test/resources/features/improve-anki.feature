Feature: Improve Anki Command
  As a CLI user
  I want to improve specific fields in existing Anki export files
  So that I can update audio, explanations, or examples without regenerating everything

  Scenario: Improve audio only for existing Anki export
    Given I have an Anki export file with content:
      """
      #separator:tab
      #html:true
      #notetype column:1
      Chinese 2	学习	xué xí		to study; to learn	<div>我在<b>学习</b>中文。<br>Wǒ zài <b>xué xí</b> zhōng wén.<br>I am studying Chinese.</div>	This is a short explanation.	学(study) + 习(practice)	y		y
      """
    When I run improve-anki with parameters "--improve-audio --audio-selections=学习:qwen-tts:Cherry"
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And the improved Anki export file should exist
    And the audio field of "学习" should not be empty
    And the etymology field of "学习" should remain unchanged
