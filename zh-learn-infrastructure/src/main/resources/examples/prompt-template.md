    examples:
      - hanzi: "Chinese word containing the character"
        pinyin: "phonetic transcription"
        translation: "English translation"
        breakdown: "Explanation of how the character contributes to the word's meaning"
      - hanzi: "Another Chinese word containing the character"
        pinyin: "phonetic transcription" 
        translation: "English translation"
        breakdown: "Explanation of how the character contributes to the word's meaning"
  - meaning: "description of meaning 2 (if applicable)"

    examples:
      - hanzi: "Chinese word for meaning 2"
        pinyin: "phonetic transcription"
        translation: "English translation"
        breakdown: "Explanation of how the character contributes to the word's meaning"

# Optional: include only if the character is the phonetic component in a phonetic series
# Otherwise output an empty list: phonetic_series: []
phonetic_series:
  - hanzi: "related character in the phonetic series"

## Requirements
- Group examples by distinct meanings/usages of the character
- Include the pinyin pronunciation for each meaning group
- Provide 1-4 examples per meaning
- Include accurate pinyin with tone marks for each word
- Provide clear English translations
- Include breakdown explanations showing how the character contributes to each word
- If the word has only one main meaning, provide one meaning group
- If other characters use this character as their phonetic component, include a top-level `phonetic_series` list with those characters (including hanzi, pinyin, meaning). Otherwise set `phonetic_series: []`.
- if A is our character under analysis, only add to the phonetic_series characters X where A is the phonetic omponent of X
- The response must be valid YAML

### STRICT OUTPUT RULES
- Output MUST be only YAML (prefer a single YAML code block or raw YAML). Do NOT include any prose before or after.
- Use spaces (2 spaces) for indentation. Do NOT use tabs.
- Keys must be exactly: words, meaning, pinyin, examples, hanzi, translation, breakdown, phonetic_series.
- Always include top-level `phonetic_series`. If none, set `phonetic_series: []`.
- Quote all string values with double quotes. If a value contains double quotes, escape them (\").
- Keep values on a single line; avoid multi-line scalars. Use commas/semicolons if needed.
- Do NOT include Markdown, backticks, or HTML in the output.
- Avoid colons in unquoted values; ensure any text with colons is quoted.
- Validate that the YAML is syntactically correct and parsable before responding.
