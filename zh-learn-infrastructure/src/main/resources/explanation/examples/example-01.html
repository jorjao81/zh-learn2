<h3>Origin: Phono-semantic compound (形声字)</h3>
<p>Traditional <span class="hanzi">憶</span><span class="pinyin">yì</span> is analyzed as <b>忄 (semantic) +
        意 (phonetic)</b>: the
    semantic component <span class="hanzi">忄</span><span class="pinyin">xīn</span> “heart, mind”
    signals mental activity, and the phonetic component <span class="hanzi">意</span><span class="pinyin">yì</span> gives
    the sound <span class="pinyin">yì</span>.
</p>
<p>Simplified <span class="hanzi">忆</span> <span class="pinyin">yì</span> replaces the right-side <span
        class="hanzi">意</span><span class="pinyin">yì</span> with a compact sign
    <span class="hanzi">乙</span><span class="pinyin">yǐ</span> as a standard simplification. The pronunciation and
    phonetic lineage are clearer in the
    traditional form (with <span class="hanzi">意</span><span class="pinyin">yì</span>), so treat <span
        class="hanzi">意</span><span class="pinyin">yì</span> as the true phonetic for
    the family.
</p>

<h3>>The Semantic Evolution:</h3>
<p>
    <b>“heart/mind + idea” → “to recall/remember.”</b> The base meaning focuses on bringing something back to mind.
</p>
<p>
    Developed common nouns/compounds for <b>“memory”</b> or <b>“recollection.”</b> Examples: <span
        class="hanzi">记忆</span><span class="pinyin">jìyì</span> “memory, to remember”; <span
        class="hanzi">回忆</span><span class="pinyin">huíyì</span> “to recollect; recollection.”
