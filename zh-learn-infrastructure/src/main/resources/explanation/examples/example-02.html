<h3>Origin: Ideographic Compound (会意字)</h3>
<p>The character <span class="hanzi">闲</span> is a simplified form of <span class="hanzi">閑</span>. The traditional form
    is a clear ideograph, combining <span class="hanzi">門</span> (mén), meaning 'gate' or 'door', with <span
        class="hanzi">木</span> (mù), meaning 'wood' or 'tree', inside it.</p>
<p>
    The image created is that of a wooden bar or beam (<span class="hanzi">木</span>) placed across a gateway (<span
        class="hanzi">門</span>) to act as a barrier or fence. The original meaning was therefore a "barricade," "fence,"
    or "to block." This created a space that was closed off and separate.
</p>

<h3>The Semantic Evolution:</h3>
<p> From the idea of a space being "closed off" or "barricaded," the meaning shifted to the state of being within such a
    quiet, undisturbed space. A person who is not engaged with the busy world outside the gate is "at leisure" or
    "idle."
</p>

<p>This state of being unburdened by work or duties became the primary modern meaning of <b>"idle," "leisure,"</b>
or <b>"free time."</b></p>

<p class="semantic-evolution-path">
    <b>A wooden bar across a gate</b> (original meaning) → <b>A closed-off, quiet space</b> → <b>The state of being
        separate from work</b> → <b>Idle / Leisure / Unoccupied</b> (modern meaning).
