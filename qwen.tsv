</ul>"	"<h3>Origin: Phono-semantic compound (形声字)</h3>
<p>The character <span class=""hanzi"">窜</span><span class=""pinyin"">cuàn</span> is composed of <b>穴 (semantic) + 串 (phonetic)</b>. The semantic component <span class=""hanzi"">穴</span><span class=""pinyin"">xué</span> “hole, burrow, den” suggests movement into or out of a confined or hidden space. The phonetic component <span class=""hanzi"">串</span><span class=""pinyin"">chuàn</span> provides the approximate sound <span class=""pinyin"">cuàn</span>, though the tones and initial consonants have diverged slightly over time.</p>
<p>In ancient forms (e.g., seal script), the character more clearly depicted an animal or person darting into a hole to escape — reinforcing the core idea of “fleeing” or “hiding.”</p>

<h3>Direct Translation and Core Meaning:</h3>
<p><b>“To flee in panic,” “to dart into hiding,” or “to escape surreptitiously.”</b> The character implies sudden, often desperate or illicit movement — typically to avoid capture, danger, or responsibility.</p>
<p>Extended meanings include: <b>to tamper with (text)</b> — as in altering something furtively — and <b>to spread (rumors, fire, etc.)</b> — suggesting rapid, uncontrolled movement.</p>

<h3>The Semantic Evolution:</h3>
<p>
    The original image of an animal or fugitive diving into a <span class=""hanzi"">穴</span> “hole” to escape danger evolved into a general verb for <b>panicked flight</b> or <b>clandestine movement</b>. From physical escape, the meaning extended metaphorically to textual tampering — as if “sneaking in” unauthorized changes — and to the rapid, uncontrolled spread of things like fire or gossip.
</p>
<p>
    Common compounds: <span class=""hanzi"">逃窜</span><span class=""pinyin"">táocuàn</span> “to flee in panic”; <span class=""hanzi"">流窜</span><span class=""pinyin"">liúcuàn</span> “to roam and commit crimes”; <span class=""hanzi"">窜改</span><span class=""pinyin"">cuàngǎi</span> “to tamper with (text)”; <span class=""hanzi"">火势窜升</span><span class=""pinyin"">huǒshì cuànshēng</span> “flames surge/spread rapidly.”
</p>
<p class=""semantic-evolution-path"">
    <b>穴 “hole” + 串 “sound cue”</b> → <b>darting into a hole to escape</b> → <b>fleeing in panic / hiding</b> → <b>tampering furtively / spreading uncontrollably</b>.
</p>

<h3>Comparison with Visually Similar Characters:</h3>
<p><b>串 (chuàn)</b> — means “to string together” (e.g., beads, kebabs). Though it serves as the phonetic in <span class=""hanzi"">窜</span>, its meaning is unrelated. Do not confuse <span class=""hanzi"">窜</span> with <span class=""hanzi"">串</span>; the addition of <span class=""hanzi"">穴</span> radically changes the meaning to imply escape or intrusion.</p>
<p><b>患 (huàn)</b> — “misfortune, affliction.” Structurally, it contains <span class=""hanzi"">心</span> under <span class=""hanzi"">串</span>, but semantically unrelated. No overlap in meaning or usage.</p>
<p><b>审 (shěn)</b> — “to examine, interrogate.” Contains <span class=""hanzi"">宀</span> (roof) over <span class=""hanzi"">申</span>, visually distinct from <span class=""hanzi"">窜</span>’s <span class=""hanzi"">穴</span> + <span class=""hanzi"">串</span>. No semantic or phonetic relation.</p>

<h3>Etymological Note and Memory Aid:</h3>
<p>The character <span class=""hanzi"">窜</span> preserves its ancient association with subterranean or hidden movement. Think of a rat <b>darting into a hole</b> (<span class=""hanzi"">穴</span>) — that’s <span class=""hanzi"">窜</span>. Whether fleeing police, altering documents in secret, or flames leaping upward, the core idea is <b>sudden, furtive, often chaotic motion</b>.</p>

</ul>"	"<h3>Origin: Ideographic Compound (会意字)</h3>
<p>The character <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span><span class=""pinyin"">jí</span> is composed of two parts: <span class=""hanzi"">疒</span><span class=""pinyin"">nè</span> (sickness radical) and <span class=""hanzi"">矢</span><span class=""pinyin"">shǐ</span> (arrow). The radical <span class=""hanzi"">疒</span> depicts a person lying on a bed, signaling illness or physical suffering. The component <span class=""hanzi"">矢</span> originally represented an arrow — a fast-moving, piercing object.</p>
<p>Together, they form an ideographic compound suggesting <b>“illness that strikes like an arrow”</b> — sudden, sharp, and swift. This visual metaphor captures the essence of acute disease or rapid onset of pain.</p>

<h3>The Semantic Evolution:</h3>
<p>
    The original meaning centered on <b>acute illness or sudden pain</b>, especially that which comes on quickly and severely — like being struck by an arrow. Over time, the meaning broadened to include any kind of <b>disease, ailment, or suffering</b>, not necessarily sudden.
</p>
<p>
    In classical texts, <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span> also developed metaphorical uses: it could mean <b>to hate or detest</b> (as in <span class=""hanzi"">疾恶如仇</span><span class=""pinyin"">jí è rú chóu</span> — “to hate evil as one hates an enemy”), drawing from the idea of illness as something repulsive or to be urgently expelled.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, because arrows fly swiftly, <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span> acquired the meaning of <b>“fast, rapid, swift”</b> — especially in literary or poetic contexts (e.g., <span class=""hanzi"">疾风</span><span class=""pinyin"">jífēng</span> “swift wind”; <span class=""hanzi"">疾行</span><span class=""pinyin"">jíxíng</span> “to move rapidly”). This usage is still alive in modern idioms and classical references.
</p>

<p class=""semantic-evolution-path"">
    <b>Arrow + sickness → sudden illness</b> → <b>any disease or pain</b> → <b>to hate (metaphorical extension)</b> → <b>swift/fast (from arrow’s speed)</b>.
</p>

<h3>Comparison with Visually Similar Characters:</h3>
<p>
    <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span> is often confused with <span class=""hanzi"">病</span><span class=""pinyin"">bìng</span>, which also means “illness.” However, <span class=""hanzi"">病</span> is a phono-semantic compound: <span class=""hanzi"">疒</span> (semantic) + <span class=""hanzi"">丙</span><span class=""pinyin"">bǐng</span> (phonetic). While <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span> implies sudden or acute illness (and retains connotations of speed or intensity), <span class=""hanzi"">病</span> is more general and often refers to chronic or prolonged sickness.
</p>
<p>
    Another look-alike is <span class=""hanzi"">瘦</span><span class=""pinyin"">shòu</span> (“thin, skinny”), which also contains <span class=""hanzi"">疒</span> but pairs it with <span class=""hanzi"">叟</span><span class=""pinyin"">sǒu</span> (old man). Do not confuse the right components: <span class=""hanzi"">矢</span> (arrow) in <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span> vs. <span class=""hanzi"">叟</span> (elder) in <span class=""hanzi"">瘦</span>.
</p>

<h3>Mnemonic & Learning Tip:</h3>
<p>
    To remember <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span>, visualize an <b>arrow (<span class=""hanzi"">矢</span>) striking a sickbed (<span class=""hanzi"">疒</span>)</b> — illness that comes swiftly and painfully. This image reinforces both its core meaning (acute disease) and its extended meaning (speed). Think: “Struck by disease like an arrow — fast and fierce.”
</p>
<p>
    Also note: In idioms, <span class=""hanzi"">疾</span> often retains its classical nuances — whether referring to hatred (“hate like an arrow strikes”) or speed (“swift as an arrow”).
